This can mean being attentive to your own physical needs and health, and focusing more on how you feel impacted by what you see, hear, smell, etc than the object you are sensing. As opposed to taking in everything at once, I tend to focus on specific details to get a picture of what the environment is like. Because of this, I can totally ignore things that might bug other people (like a room being too cold), or obsess about something relatively minor (like wanting a glass of water).I find it natural to compare things. But this is mostly unintentional and happens very quickly. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s often less about comparing two specific things (say, seeing a house and being reminded of where I grew up) and more so how that object affects me generally, and how I categorize it based on that. Perhaps I could say itâ€™s less about comparing two specific objects to each other and instead of comparing various sensations to a specific form. You could compare it to classifications in biology but for everything I experience.  In terms of â€™s usual image of traditionalism, I think thereâ€™s two parts.

Neither is . They are patterns of cognition. Rationalizing feelings by looking at cognitive functions, while seeming helpful on the outside, probably won't help you overcome what you're going through. Some actions that have helped me, and I hope you find helpful:Take some time and space for yourself and examine what you're thinking and feeling. Don't judge what you're feeling as good or bad, and don't rationalize. Just observe and accept.This process will hopefully help you realize why you are feeling the way you are by keeping your mind clear. Though there are many circumstances and outside occurances that will influence how you feel, try to narrow down the cause by observing your thoughts without adding to them. Usually the cause will be internal, and specific. I find any external problem I run into has deeper roots in my mind. Usually there's a conflict of interest that you need to unravel. Narrow down the problem. Once the problem has been narrowed down, you are better equipped to solve it.

We got along really well when I was young, not so well in my late teens, and get along fine now (probably about par for the course as far as parents go).  To me,  are the ultimate â€œyouâ€™ll understand when youâ€™re olderâ€? type. There are things about my step-dad I hated as a kid but really appreciate (or at least get) now that Iâ€™m older, to an extent I canâ€™t compare with my mom () or my dad (). They arenâ€™t there to be your buddy, theyâ€™re there to be a parent.- As parents they will not treat you as an equal. Youâ€™re their child and they treat parenting as a job. They have a responsibility to you to make sure youâ€™re raised well, to make their spouseâ€™s life a bit easier, and to society to ensure their child has a positive impact overall. The rules they apply to you may not apply to them but this is because the relationship is inherently not equal.-  They love to teach. Theyâ€™ll teach you how to do anything if you ask. Theyâ€™ll try to make sure you understand your school work and teach you practical skills.- They will try to instill practical sense into you, practical meaning the way the world works - not how it should work, but the way it currently works. This is so you can succeed in the world we currently have. IIt doesnâ€™t matter if you think it sucks: you have to deal with it anyway.-  They are willing to hear you out but you need to be able to provide a logical argument. They care about your well being and have thought about whatâ€™s best for you, so if you disagree you need to prove how you can succeed otherwise. They are bad long-term planners so they can get worked up about this.- A lot of what is great about them as parents happens behind the scenes. They make sure everything is in order. My step-father manages all money in his house-hold and he does it well.  Heâ€™s the hardest worker I know: he runs his own seasonal business, works a second job, and does all sorts of things around the house. These arenâ€™t things you appreciate when youâ€™re growing up.- They will discipline you if they feel itâ€™s needed. Disciplining is teaching their child to be a better person. It demonstrates how the world works, and itâ€™s meant to directly shape your actions. If youâ€™re a block of marble, they arenâ€™t afraid to take a chisel and shape you. As the artist they have a better view of you than the sculpture. They care about the kind of person you are and want you to be the best you can be, even if that means hurting your feelings.All that said, theyâ€™re really bad at dealing with emotions. I will say this to their benefit - they feel a lot more than their tough exterior lets on.

It seems arbitrary, and also disregards the interaction between the leading and creative functions. Do I take it to mean all  valuing types think in terms of models? Or just  doms? What about ESxJ types? It doesn't seem well thought out, and by browsing the first few pages of the thread you linked it doesn't seem like anyone could provide a solid example of what this distinction looks like in practice. There's a lot of stuff like that peppered throughout this post. There are many assumptions that I don't think are accurate or, at least, meaningful. A lot of what you wrote is very incomplete.Not really. If there's a meaningful comparison to be made, spell it out. It's not that there aren't connections to be made between functions - only that they are context specific. In terms of general patterns between functions, you can take any two functions and compare/contrast. Your conclusion that  and , or / can't be compared in the same way is a bit baffling.

I donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m suppose to take from it â€“ a pretty broad statement, thus my broad question, haha. I couldnâ€™t relate to the main character (or any of the characters), in his attitude or in how he saw things, which was a problem because thatâ€™s a key point for me when Iâ€™m reading fiction. The book felt pessimistic for the sake of it. I donâ€™t know if it was trying to show me that I should be a pessimist, or how silly the character was for being so. Overall, it was a bit of a slog for me to get through. I guess the question, for myself, after reading the book was â€œwhy was this book written?â€?. Thatâ€™s something I havenâ€™t been able to answer. I might not be looking at it the right way.My question to you is more along the lines of: what makes it a stand out book to you? Is it a book that you relate to in some way, or did you learn something from it? Is it something you enjoyed reading?

It's true that as systems they focus on different things and contain different concepts.

MBTI and Socionics have different focuses and therefore different understandings, but I would argue that they are studying the same thing in the end.", "MBTI focuses on the functions that are valued by a type, not the 4 that are strongest. Most people are strong with functions they don't value but won't consider then as important. An  will be proficient in  but favour use of , for example. Likewise, they will value , though they will not be very good at using it.

What it's measuring is how each function acts as opposed to how strong it is (though a test will have to simplify this). The best way to understand your type is to look at the breakdown of each type and how the information elements fit into Model A. I.E.  serves a different purpose when in the leading function vs the creative function.Tests won't be able to measure this perfectly. The two easiest things to look for are what your leading function is and what your PoLR function is. The base function is what you strive for (if you're , you are using  to reach  goals, versus being and  to use  towards  goals). The PoLR function is what you see no value in. When its value is brought to your attention it makes you uncomfortable or may make you lash out. With the  the PoLR is  (use of force, conquest generally), and with the  it's  (generally pure logic with no practical use). In your test result this is what conflicts (the leading function doesn't match what the PoLR function would be) so from this point it's best to review the descriptions and see what works best for you.Edit: to address your own edit, strength plays a part. But I think that strength is the wrong way to put it. Each function in each type has its own strengths and weaknesses. It's more about observing how they act and how they are strengths/weaknesses than a test assessing how strong/valued something is (I guess this is mostly me ranting about the innacuracy of tests at the end of the day, haha. But I hope you get my meaning.)", "Yep, it's a matter of practise, obsession over specific details, and changing things over time to get better.  will see subjective details that others might miss, and tends to overlook things that other people find important.", "Very true, though it seems the OP is building an illusion of self-defeat rather than an illusion of self-fulfilliment. Though I guess it is rather self-fulfilling in its own way. Op is being truthful about their perception about themselves, which is good, but this self-perception isn't an accurate depiction of reality.The issue is being able to recognize these thought-processes as illusions and plan the steps to move forward, which isn't an easy task for every person or every situation. /u/fvhdlfshksdj, some things I hope you can put to use:It might help to separate value judgements from facts. The basic list above does not consist of facts. It consists of perceptions and opinions. Instead of this, try writing specific statements about the topic, like, \"The last time I successfully completed a task was...\", \"The last time I gave up on completing a task was...\", \"When I quit xyz task, I quit after...\", etc. General statements like what you have written are covering up the truth. Really go into detail and provide some specifics so you see what's actually happening. This may take time, which is fine. From there, you can more rationally make decisions on how to proceed. Pretend you're giving advise to a friend. Our perceptions of ourselves often cloud our own decision-making, especially when we're under pressure. If a friend came to you with a set of problems and facts about what happened, how would you perceive the situation? What steps could they take to better it?  As situational advice, don't feel like you have to rush into a career path, or that college/university is the best option right now.

If we give them the benefit of the doubt theyâ€™re not trying to be mean (trying to hide their reasons to me indicates that they donâ€™t want to hurt your feelings) but they probably need a break. Especially if this isnâ€™t someone youâ€™ve known a long while, give it some time hanging out every once and a while and you should become closer. Once youâ€™re closer youâ€™ll hang out more. Donâ€™t force hanging out if itâ€™s draining for you or her, or if you donâ€™t enjoy your time with her. And just a note on confrontation - my friend hates that in general. Confrontation gets thrown right back in whoeverâ€™s face. But: theyâ€™re very open to honest, even blunt discussion.

I saw an interview with Laurie Anderson (artist and musician, and an amazing one) where she says something along the lines of \"if you love something you'll be great at it\". That's something I really believe: whether it's a specific skillset or something broad, anyone will succeed if they really want to. It may not be conventional, but it will still be great. Anything can be art (though not everything is art) and because it's so flexible no one type is more suited to it.When you have something so broad that Bruce Nauman and Hokusai both fit under the umbrella of art, type becomes irrelavant and, I think, useless when talking about how \"good\" any type is.

I disagree. If someone takes a long time to do something simple, generally they are worse than someone who can do the same thing faster. I would also add that the more practice someone has, the less time it takes to do a job well. A plumber who's never fixed a toilet will spend a while the first time. A seasoned professional will diagnose the problem right away and fix it in a timely manner. I don't see how this doesn't apply to typology.I don't really have much to say regarding the actual discussion at hand, or your contention of peppermint-kiss's typing abilities. I only think (and this is not directed at you, but more the conversation above) that meta-conversations about how good or bad someone is at typing are way less constructive than discussing the typings themselves. The same criticisms folks are leveling at peppermint-kiss (no discussion, no evidence, etc) can be applied to what they're saying, and at 90% of typings in this sub.

I knew an  who was roommates with the psychopath I outlined in another post in this topic. This wasn't an emotional relationship - it was mostly just a convenience of two folks splitting the bills.

Despite his thoughts on the situation, the  lived with this person until they kicked him out. He never took any action to get rid of this person from his life and was not very good at convincing others of the dangers of this person. I'm not entirely sure, beyond knowing this person was a lier, that  he had a grasp of what the end game was. And that's the thing, psychopaths aren't very logical in their actions - they're manipulative. Logically the things they do don't really add up, so an observer if left to think that it makes no sense and will give up there. One of the psychopath's strengths is a reliance that even though someone sees through their bullshit, no action will be taken. I think  are very susceptible to this. And yes, it will prevent an  from getting caught up in something that causes them significant harm, but they're still left dealing with someone in an unpleasant situation and they aren't very good at helping others who get roped in. And in this particular example, despite the horrible experience the  had with this person, he would be polite and give them drives home after work. Seemed to work out in the psychopath's advantage.Another thing to watch out for as an  is that it's relatively easy for a psychopath to diminish your credibility.

They will also get frustrated when someone seems to disregard their advice, is unwilling to learn, or isn't putting in effort. And again,  doms tend to have a stricter opinion on these things than other types might. I think part of this is the responsibility they take in these situations. If someone screws up, they likely feel they can help fix the situation. And if they aren't able to, it adds to their frustration.Their thought process is also pretty oblivious to things like \"am I frustrated?\", \"am I upsetting other people?\", \"can I say this more nicely?\", etc. Instead, questions about how to get things done, be successful at the task at hand, and communicate their direct thoughts are at the forefront. It's very possible they don't realize how they come across or even how they feel at the time. It isn't a complete solution, but bringing up their actions in a calmer situation can help them be more mindful.

The \"language of business\" is just a nice add on to help me through running a potential small business in the future so I kind of see it as a double whammy.

However, Nuclear Pharmacy is an interesting option.. but the length of the program sounds even longer just by looking at the word Nuclear lol (I assume it is longer). In terms of having it pretty good are you referring to their pay and their quality of life (I'm guessing they're not stressed out individuals such as retail pharmacists) and their demands at work and what is expected of them at their job?

Or do you mean should I focus on one field within the sys admin career and just stick with it and get better at it until I find a job that I may utilize the set of skills in (I'm guessing it would be an area where I get really good at)? I am willing to buy the book and read each chapter and go through the exercises so long that I find out if this is right for me or not.

This is my final plan of action.. it may lead me into a different direction but this is it for now. The degree program for A+ certification at my school takes about 1 year, what schools offer courses where I can finish within a few months?

I definitely do not like retail an would not like to go back. I'm more and more inclined to choose accounting due to reasons outlined on this topic, however, I just read something about accounting becoming an automated job in the future. I know it seems silly to think that they will all be taken by robots but it seems plain as day that if a robot/computer can do the same menial tasks that an accountant can do then I wonder how fast of a rate will jobs be taken away by these computers/robots in the near future (I'm guessing 20% of jobs).

I'll check this out and read more about it and it's programs and number of jobs in my area. It seems like a really cool career to get into especially the IT side you mentioned.. I'm beginning to favor the technology careers the more I work in retail pharmacy (I just don't know if I can handle interacting with patients anymore.. it is overwhelming in a retail setting and it might only be slightly better in a hospital setting with less of a crowd of people trying to get their prescriptions ready in only 10 minutes such as in retail pharmacy). But, this career if better than hospital setting (like you said) is definitely an option thank you for letting me know about it I will check it out and look more in depth.", "well my hobby involves gambling somewhat.. if playing money on an online casino website such as 5 dimes. I play groups of numbers in the pick 3 lottery and keep track of a wagering (progressive wagering - martingale), set up a playing window of draws to play the list of numbers that I am looking at, and keep eye on budget to ensure best ROI if I win within the play window of draws (if not I set up a stop loss limit that isn't too high and will break my bankroll). So, I mean I don't feel bad about gambling as long as its done in a methodical manner with a lot of self discipline and energy devoted towards creating and maintaining a system.", "Well.. that is a whole lot to consider when looking into this career. It seems like owning a pharmacy will be the most difficult thing to do (rather than other retail businesses that are less expensive and don't have to deal with so many insurance companies). After getting rid of my debt I would have to work a couple years to build some profit for capital. With the amount of loans in pharmacy that could take me 5 years or more. Even then.. I would need enough money to run the business plus emergency funds just in case something happens to it or something comes along the way. I have done alot of those methods in my B.A. for biology (memorization and core concepts) so I'm pretty familiar with that process of studying. The length of the program (4 years) and the fact that working part time to take care of my current debts while being enrolled in the program might be difficult with the amount of credits per semester (workload might be extremely difficult, do-able but really stressful).

Don't tell me this is a turbo tax/ H&amp;R automated systems joke.", "The only reason I keep pharmacy as a choice is because it has personal ties with me. My dad (who passed away in 2007) suggested me to get into Pharmacy (I was in high school at the time) since he saw my interests lied within nutrition and I was passionate about getting my body in shape while eating healthy meals. I have always been a nutrition fanatic and have bought and tested many natural supplements and nootropics to enhance my body and brain. I have given suggestions to friends and family on supplements and nootropics and I feel as though pharmacy is a level beyond what my interests are in but at the pharmaceutical grade/level. However, I have been busy with work and other things and supplements and nutrition have been held back. I don't feel it is a strong passion anymore. I know that isn't too much of a reason to choose pharmacy but it is the closest field to where my interests are (although bio-hacking and seeing how I and others react to supplements is no longer a strong passion of mine anymore due to financial reasons).", "yes a lot of times I get this.. my best guess is the same as yours..

Ive lashed out a couple times explaining that I know what was said I don't need an explanation 15x etc.. it just makes it worse so I just listen and nod and say \"oh okay\" or \"really?\" that seems to work for me for the most part while I hold in my aggravation of feeling clueless to that person when I don't feel I'm as incompetent as they think I am lol.", "Geez I'm going to set up an appointment with an endo soon I hope I don't get the same answer my levels are similar to you except I don't know my estradiol.

The system aspect of it is interesting though.", "Yes I think I can make money from the pick 3 lottery in particular because 1000 combos are much easier to predict if you convert those 1000 into boxed plays (220 total). One of my systems plays 68 boxed plays. Another one of my systems uses due filters and progressively wagers after 4 consecutive losing drawings for a particular filter and progressively wagers for each 1 losing drawing for another filter that I track  so it's something ive been tracking and seeing good results for two states that I am looking at Georgia and Michigan. Of course this would require a big bankroll to start playing for real but it's good to track and create multiple systems and see how they do so someday once you build a bankroll you can make even more money (which is what I plan to do someday). Would like to automate my ideas into a program instead of doing it the slow way on pencil and paper and that's why I'm here in particular.. if I might have to develop another skill it might as well be programming and I feel I'm in the right spot this is a very informative subreddit but this dilemma is too specific and has certain criteria that I'm not familiar with in the programming community and would like some direction if possible.

I feel exhausted after talking with people (and my job is pharmacy retail so it involves patient contact -- answering phones, answering questions, some retail scripted dialogue, socializing with other pharmacy technicians and with the pharmacist at every needed moment that calls for them needing you or you needing them or just making small talk with them so you don't feel like an outcast). Anxiety is something I didnt realize I had a problem with until I started this job two years ago.. but subconsciously I knew I had much longer because I can't remember any moment in my life where I held a conversation longer than 5-10 minutes with anyone. I'm  trying to resolve this by finding a psychologist and psychiatrist that I feel a good fit with (been through 2 therapists that I didn't gel with) before I decide to start taking medication. If I do take medication I will try to get my doctors office to do the genesight test (if my insurance covers it) it's like a DNA test to find which medications will work for your mind and body based on your genes.

I've been thinking of getting on zoloft (have been prescribed by both my doctor and nurse practitioner) to get rid of my anxiety with girls.. and this I've had so many crushes when I was in middle school and have had similar situations that you've been in. I would recommend therapy before taking medication.. and I think (from my own perspective) that it's a mix of self esteem/confidence and some generalized anxiety in those social situations so therapy could help with that maybe through CBT, meditation, journaling, etc. I'm looking into that for myself hope you seek out the same help and become a better you.

I disagree with the 99% statistic, but I can see that you are trying to distinguish the 1% remaining as those who spend regardless of skill-up events. I would wager the true statistic of those who save for skill-ups is closer to the number of players who do not spend frivolously. If that number is 99% then so be it.Agreed, I would say we value our gems until Sugo time. There's is an interesting theory in behavioral economics called Prospect Theory. I think it helps explain this. The short version is that people tend to be risk-seeking in loss and risk averse in gains. Let's think of loss and gains in terms of money, where loss is the spending of money and gain is simply not spending. If we take Sugo as loss (of money), then we see that more people will be willing to spend more money in order to actualize that 1% drop rate (sweet sweet legends). Now, if we take skill ups as gains, then we see that more people are willing to be risk averse and wait for skill-ups. The outcome of skill-ups is a known (and also relatively high compared to legend rates) probability, so we are more willing to wait for an increase in that outcome. I agree that \"pinching pennies\" as you so described is not the best way to turn a profit. However, we only really save our copies to skill up because we do not want to spend money to get more copies. There was a table of probabilities posted on this subreddit that provided a perfect explanation as to why saving is better, though I cannot recall who posted it or when it was posted (sorry).I am not trying to argue a side here, but it seems both DblBeast and kanneck are exaggerating to some degree. 99% cannot be representative of anything speculative (well except for the 99%, or dare I say, 100% of Bandai employees profiting from this game).", "As the day comes to a close, I'd like to give shoutouts to /u/SamAdamsGaming, /u/Hertzdawg, and an anon who added me via battlenet.

From what I read, he's saying if Bandai gave us Skill up to unload our boxes, those who are not Cash Cows/Whales will have more room to do other things such as pull for the upcoming Sugo or farm even more Skill Up material.You have to realize that the majority of players do not spend money on Gems or only spend on Sugofests. These are the players to which DblBeast refer to. Given that Cash Cows/Whales will spend with or without Skill Up events, Bandai needs to cater more to the majority of players who will *potentially* spend money on gems in order to get that extra farm in. Also keep in mind that unloading the box factors in as well. For example, after Doffy (assuming most people paid to farm him), a Skill Up to help lessen the load will generate *more* space for future farming. As it so happened, we got a surprise Doffy raid two weeks after everyone spent money on him. If a Skill Up happened in between to unload the boxes, we'd all have more space to hold him again. Those who did not max him will want to spend money in order to do so, and those who missed out the first time but unloaded some Skill Manuals or copies of Perona during the Skill Up will now pay to farm Doffy. It's a win/win for both Bandai (because they will generate more income) and the players (because we are now willing to pay to farm).", "I can help!BNET ID: Designator 1216"], "softlabels": {"E/I": 0.5686900958466454, "S/N": 0.6833910034602076, "T/F": 0.4114391143911439, "J/P": 0.9293893129770993}, "hardlabels": {"E/I": "E", "S/N": "S", "T/F": "F", "J/P": "J"}}

Sometimes in the past, I was even a little worried that I find Nathan Fillion so predestined to play Nathan Drake, that it could be jinxed and wouldn't meet my expectations. But DAMN. He nails it. His voice, how he speaks and acts(though it doesn't seem like acting but rather like it's naturally?) and, of course, his looks(lots of people thought Fillion would be too old for Nate but I somehow thought that, if they're going to make a movie, it could be about the Malaysian Job which gets mentioned a lot in U4. So the age would fit indeed, imo)While watching it I had such a bright smile on my face: with every scene that showed how well they know/engaged with the series, with every cocky comment and every facial expression of Fillion, the music, the fight scenes AND of course: that divine transition.

I had to learn a lot about myself to be able tell them apart at least a bit. If you want to question it: start with the anxiety. What the situation does to you, why does it makes you feel like something is wrong? Then try to filter out the source: after the alarming feeling of something being off, what were your first thoughts? Where did they went? If you know your anxieties and what triggers them, it could be \"easy\" to follow the feeling to the source and realizing, where it comes from. When I try to differ between I also can make a difference between how they feel but I think that depends a lot on how anxiety affects someone. My intuition is kinda set in my tummy, it's an remarkable, strange feeling but none that would give me stress. While the Anxiety starts in my head and goes down in my back and heart.

With that reply you're already helping me so much and far more and objective, than anyone I told this about yet. It gives me a lot to think and reflect about. Thank you so much. I'm close to tears because it's so necessary to recall this facts back into my mind.I, actually, have such a lot to say about all this. I hope it's okay.First of all: the feelings for him being about him. Yes. God, I just realized that I only talked about our friendship and how important it is to me and  how afraid I am of changing it to something less with me confessing being the cause. The thing is: I'm always ready to be there for him. I mean, that's all I did the past months and I don't expect anything for it. What kind of a friendship would that be if you except something in return. I just want to support him as best as possible. I don't expect him to have mutual feelings, I never did, to be honest.  All I wanted was to be honest with him and to be able to use my positive feelings to care properly.This also somehow answers the part about me wanting more out of the relationship. I can't say I don't, of course. But I won't let this wish having an impact on my behaviour. Because that's all it is: a wish. Not an exception or something I could get entitled with. And as you said: that's not up to me and imo I'm not in the position to be disappointed if it not comes to that. I'd never dare to expect a commitment since this would be toxic and harmful and that's the absolute last thing I'd ever want to be to someone. From the very beginning all I deeply cared for was building a good and supportive friendship with/for him so I could be there for a person who deserves so much good.I think I'll text him today in the evening, apologize for my behaviour and explain myself and everything around properly with focusing on what's really important instead of leaving one mess of a selfish voicemail.

She could've also used the situation and cut off the contact with you completely. But she didn't. So I think she's not playing games with you. We tend to overthink a lot, imagine all the outcomes and possibilities and when there are anxieties and insecurities too, it /can/ get really hard on us. Especially on new situations.So, maybe, the best way to handle is to give it some more time but play with open and sincere cards. Step by step. Show her, that you want to understand her, but that there's no pressure. Ask her questions if you're interested in how her mind/thinking works and stay sensitive. It's very hard to explain the way we're ticking because people often don't \"get\" us so misunderstandings and worse are happening.

Nothing big is happening but you can **feel** what's underneath. Nathan and Elena are one of my, if not THE, favourite pairing of all time. I love their relationship so much and to see how it develops over the different games is one thing. But to see how much TLOU had an impact on them when it comes to individual character and interpersonal relationship development is so damn amazing.

I don't fall in love often, it maybe happened three times in my 27 years. So when it happens it's even more overwhelming because meeting/knowing a person that kinda gets you and all ... I don't know how to properly put it into words. But the risk of losing myself and being an emotional rollercoaster that just knows extreme ups and extreme downs (aided from depression too) is high when I'm not able to distance those powerful feelings from myself.", "I've wondered about that too!

Personally, when I'm close to the station(for example when new waves spawn at the other side of the map) and I have at least 5 motes: I bank them. If there's a bounty for banking 15 motes I only try it in the beginning of a game and only once. Idk, in my opinion I'm not a bad but rather moderate PvP/teamplayer and Gambit is one hell of fun for me. But since I know, that I still lack with some mechanism etc. I'm extra careful with not risking too much and don't be a bother for the team. Don't know why people can't stop thinking only about themselves and work only with their ego instead of working with/for the team.That one day the Drifter already called for our Primeval to be summoned and we all banked what we had left. Except for one guy who walked around with the remaining 14 motes and he went straight past the station to another enemy wave because he intended to make it 15. We didn't even need that last one but he died and so we've lost a moderate amount of time until we were able to finally call the primeval :/", "For real.

I'm so overfed by players crying about this or that weapon being too powerful and thinking it makes a certain game mode \"less fun\". I'm a mediocre PvP player at best and sure it's annoying when you're being taken down faster than you can decide if you should hide from or try to take down the invader. So what? Do better next time, be prepared. Man, we've won rounds with Sleepers on the opposing team often enough and also lost rounds where the other hadn't used a sleeper even once. Making the entertainment of a PvP mode depent on how you can handle an opponents loadout is some kind of a cushy excuse for not working on your own way to play a game which has it's mechanisms for a reason.", "Thank you so much for sharing your story! I'm sorry that you have to fight anxiety and depression too. It's a hard one. But I'm glad, that you were able to talk to her and that it took a big weight off from your chest.

You did pretty good! :) I wrote him another, far better and focused on him text yesterday in the evening and we already texted a little bit. He said he's going to answer me properly later today and until now we're talking as usual so yeah. I'm feeling much better actually.   I hope you'll get an answer too, no matter which one.

Sometimes the world seems like it just doesn't give a crap about you, you're not alone in that feeling. I use to love music and playing the clarinet in grade school so when my father bought me an old beat up different type of clarinet I had so much trouble that I eventually gave up. I used to love to draw but I would always be discouraged by my narc to give it up because I couldn't make money with it. A lot of things I'll never get back and everytime I try to go back to those things which I still love to start again I am hampered by re-surging emotions of shame and failure.Does that sound dark and depressing? Well, I guess it is, but I'm not going to be one of those \"normal\" people who will just tell you everything will be alright if you just be positive. But that doesn't mean there is no hope. We really are capable of what we want, we just have to work towards it, but most of all get away from our narcs. I implore you to strive towards improving yourself in ways they can't just take away that will also boost your confidence. An example is exercising. You will feel better and be better. When I started lifting weights my nfather started laying on his usual hate. He was jealous that he didn't have the drive to improve himself, also making very uncomfortable remarks.

They assume you are going to join for sure, so if you decide to drop out and decide the Army life just isn't for you they will plaster you face on the front door publicly insulting you for \"lack of intestinal fortitude\".When we went to the schools they told us to be careful of what we say. Can't be telling the truth to discourage potential recruits can we? But the worst of recruiters are those that went through it, came out broken and scarred and still do the mental gymnastics to convince themselves and others that it's such a good deal.

Now we all live in the same house and it's a chain of putdowns.After reading about NPD and taking note of my own experiences with other people I would say that narcissism is mostly applicable to males.

Treating it like an artpiece to trade in is what has lead to disgustingly pseudoscientific studies and terrible shows like Big Bang Theory. Seriously, that show is cancer. I've run into too many folks whose best argument for things is \"cuz science!\". How is that any different than \"cuz God!\"? It's not.  Sometimes inputs change and what we thought we knew yesterday may change dramatically. Frankly, Flat Earth doesn't really affect you. Some people believe stones have vibrational energies. Some people believe in a mystic divinity in the heavens. Usually these beliefs are based around some significant incident they experienced or a certain piece of information or skepticism they ran across.I worked in cartography and can honestly say it wouldn't really affect us much whether the Earth was round or flat since so much is based on relative positioning. There are a crap ton of different models for which to build a grid system and somehow we got by on them despite sometimes significant variances. Plenty of freeway planners and canal engineers will tell you the same.We can only truly know reality best when we experience it for ourselves and even then our perceptions can affect what truths we draw from it. For all you know you are in a matrix and everything we see and do is part of a computer simulation. And there are out there studies that have found evidence of interesting things like scalar energy. Even mundane things like the antiseptic properties of honey and silver were lost to time and popular science, treated like snake oil until scientists went back to it and discovered that the folk remedies were based on actual, repeatable effects.There's much to know out there. What we think we know may change. A paradigm shift is hard for most people to handle, sometimes they'll hurt and kill to protect it. But don't be that way. Don't let something goofy like this ruin your friendship. Keep calm, and just keep learning and encourage that with others.

I've stopped talking about it since then, even to close friends who might leak such info through the grape vine.It also helps to realize that this is generally how it works for men, but opposite for women.

And this stuff wears down on you. Before I never felt envy or jealousy towards other people, but when I see someone cry about how they've not had sex for a month or seen their bf/gf for the past week it makes me mad. Of course I can't say that and I know it's the wrong attitude which is something all the \"optimists\" be quick to jump on.

Aromatherapy really works wonders. Lavender and vanilla work so well to calm and put me in a nice place. Also got one of those cheap acupuncture mats. It's just a foam mat with plastic spikes you lay on. Kinda painful at first, but it gets the blood flowing and distracts you from your depression. Combine the aromatherapy with the mat, meditation, and some chill music and the depression really lifts. If you decide to try that I hope it works.", "Waiting on a narc seems to be very common judging from the comments. I've experienced the same.

Please see your guidance councilor first, voice your concerns that you are not being properly challenged, and see if there are any vocational options at your school. Now, these may or may not offer photography training, but they do offer classes in far more practical and worthwhile trades than, say, your 6th year of World History (SIGH).

These are online programs which sometimes even offer free computers (you do have to return them when you graduate, but it's a nice perk). I did this for 3 years of high school, and if I'd been a little more disciplined, I could have graduated in half the time. This is embarrassing to admit, but I sort of did this in reverse - barely did any schoolwork the first 2 years, then completed 3 years in 1 to catch up with my friends! If you're a Junior (?) now, you'll wrap up in no time with a bit of discipline.

If you take this route, you'll have to accept that even if photography doesn't end up working out for you, or if it's not your life's passion, your options will be a lot more limited in life.

Vatican II did not open the doors for anything and everything. I think Voris' strength is that he moves deductively, he starts with a certain church teaching and shows why the 'nutty theology' does not work - I believe it is pretty strong reasoning.

Firstly, make sure you do maths. Just about every university offering CS requires you to have a Maths A-Level. I've found a few exceptions like Nottingham and King's where it's not totally required, but not doing maths really limits your choices. Besides, maths is huge part of computer science. I was never amazing at maths but I did get an A at GCSE. However I did find A-Level wayyyyy harder than GCSE. I struggled at first but if you put tons of work in, you can still succeed in A-Level maths.

Honestly, I only took because I thought I was good at it and then struggled throughout all of year 12. It is so much harder and requires a lot of work.

If you take it, it will probably be the hardest subject you take. Of course I can't speak from experience, I've seen some of my most capable friends get Bs and Cs in exams and so many people are taking resits. Nonetheless, chemistry opens loads of doors for you and is required for pharmacy so definitely take it. For computer science, maths is a requirement. Maths is a huge part of computer science and not taking it will close a lot of doors for you.

Focus as much as you can because I can tell you now that some incredibly intelligent kids in my class screwed up when they were in your year and now they have to aim much lower.For maths, past papers are the key. Practice all of them and make sure you understand what you're doing. If you need to work on a topic, just find that topic in past papers and work on them. Treat every unfinished paper as an unused resource. Once you've done them all, repeat and record progress. You will find that maths, physics and computing papers tend to recycle their questions every now and then so gain a firm understanding of those mark schemes.I'm just rambling now but hopefully it helps. Overall, it is definitely possible to get those As. Let me know if you (or anyone else in the thread) need help with anything like technique or resources.BTW I'm guessing you're hoping to be a future compsci student too. Let me know how that works out.", "Try holding on for another week, mainly because maths is a very useful subject. If you're looking to go into Computer Science or economics in uni (I'm just assuming, idk), maths will be a required subject from a large majority of universities.

I am currently making a financial market pattern prediction program for my A-level coursework using Java if that helps explain.Anyways, if you're worried about not knowing enough, don't sweat it.

I don't see any harm in applying for an ABB university as a firm . However you need to focus on how you can improve on your current subject grades. Perhaps try and resit the maths module you got a U in? I've been looking at CS courses myself and it seems to be pretty important that you achieve a good grade in maths. Look at how you did in your other modules and find areas where you could resit to improve your grade. Also, chat to your teachers about your predicted grades to see if you're in the right ballpark. I've got a lot of programming experience myself but I doubt it would make a huge difference in the application.

Physics, maths and biology tend to recycle their questions from time to time. So yeah, past papers is the key. You probably already know this, I'm just speaking from experience. Before my year 12 mocks, I basically wrote a huge textbook of notes and barely touched a past paper resulting in pretty embarrassing mock results. I only turned it around by flying through piles of past papers.  Best of luck, bud.

You said that you live with your boyfriend and two close friends. If that's the case, they should be people who you can feel comfortable around, who would be willing to listen to what you have to tell them and at least *try* to support you when you're feeling frustrated, all the more if they are the source of it, whether or not it's intentional.Maybe you can consider calmly speaking with only one of them first (possibly your boyfriend?) to discuss what's on your mind and devise a solution with that person together, if not get some helpful suggestions on how you could approach the other two. Talking one-on-one might make it easier for you to share your thoughts in a more secluded, personal manner. There's no need to be rude or angry, but you don't want to come across as a pushover, either. You can also let them know that their actions bear negative consequences on your well-being; for instance, having people come over too late would mean you can't sleep while they're being loud. It's worse if you have classes or work the following day, or even if it's just to relax after a thoroughly exhausting week. Depending on how they respond, you guys can potentially reach a compromise. Or, you could choose to segue into this conversation from another while you guys are hanging out or doing something fun together, so that there's no tension and you can proceed in a relaxed atmosphere.The point is, if you can convey yourself calmly without seeming like a doormat, explain to them that their negligence/lack of consideration is genuinely hurting you but that you really want to work things out together, I don't see why they would give you a hard time. When a group of people made a conscious decision to live under the same roof, there was essentially a tacit agreement that they would respect each other's space and property.

Some of the arguments against a romantic relationship don't fit in the context of the story, mainly the one that says interspecies romance is unheard of or wrong. There's no confirmation that it's actually \"unheard of,\" and, the movie itself encourages open-mindedness and the belief that people can do as they choose. With all the implicit political and social commentary, it would be far less of a surprise if they ever adopt in order to have a family. Or, they can keep staying together as a happily-unmarried-ever-after team and kick more ass.The ambiguity is a solid note to finish on since it can cater to fans of either a romantic or platonic relationship. If anyone's really displeased, they can go off and take to the pen, draw some art or write fanfiction. I was just glad to see that a male-female duo didn't end up kissing by the final scene. Most of Disney's past movies were always about the rush and fantasy, so it was nice to see a highly compatible pair taking things slow and building trust in each other as equals for once. That said, I would definitely be interested to see how a sequel takes them and their story further.", "Team Mystic. The \"analyze\" part of the introductory text and calm vibes appealed to me. I also liked the icy motif from it above the other two, which totally makes sense since it's represented by Articuno. There appears to be [some speculation]( that your team choice affects gameplay, despite it being mostly unfounded information. Although, based on how often the game horribly bugs out and the servers crash, the developers are probably going to implement fixes and updates in the coming months, which potentially leaves room for any of those \"team perks\" to actually be valid. I did hear that trading will be a feature added in sometime soon.", "At the same time, I do think that the beauty of his placing tarot card references in the series rests in that there isn't a defined right or wrong way to interpret or even manipulate them. If anything, that's the reason why he uses them liberally as a conduit for symbolic storytelling, foreshadowing, and detailing motifs that appropriately resonate with the representative character - which all tie profoundly into the meanings of the cards as opposed to the official symbolism illustrated on the face of the cards themselves.This brings me to the point that whether or not tears (or other objects) are present in the cards' symbology appears to matter little to Ishida; in Takizawa's \"15\" case, he drew it as such to relay the turning point in his life that ultimately led to his monstrous metamorphosis, due to his heretofore paralyzing fear and overwhelming feelings of inferiority. Reading the meaning for \"The Devil\" gives me a matching description for his situation. Other series like JoJo and the Persona games take a similar approach to applying tarot references within them as well.Anyway, I understand what you are saying. I just thought that a reference doesn't always have to be valid only if the symbols are used as the cards depict them without the need for the numbers. Numerology is an important tool in the divination of these cards too, so I found it to be pretty interesting when I'd spot them as I read. Apologies if I misconstrued your comment.", "This honestly doesn't sound too farfetched.The manga so far has shown us that, yes, he was beheaded, and that Gintoki/Takasugi/Katsura stood around with the head right there as tribute - but no body. It's entirely possible that the Tendoshuu took the corpse away and kept it \"alive\" all this time via mechanical means, in order to turn him against his own students in the future, since it would disturb them severely by his appearance alone.", "It's a type of purple orchid, called 'shiran' (<U+7D2B><U+862D>) in Japanese. [Here they are again with Arima in a color illustration.]( are a few different meanings for this flower that can apply to him. Generally, they are:* \"You will not be forgotten\"* \"Beautiful person\"* \"My love for you will not change\"Hairu was known to greatly admire Arima and look up to him, so the flashback with the flowers served to illustrate how this feeling hasn't changed.In the corpse field, Kaneki was awed by Arima's sheer presence. There definitely is the aspect of \"beauty in death\" that was being played with, but in terms of Kaneki's emotions, it's as simple as realizing that the man in front of him is Arima Kishou - a god of death, elegant and invincible. What stood out to me was how fitting the first definition is for both people to one another as well as their own selves. With the epilogue in the original TG and :re, we knew that even after Arima \"killed\" Kaneki, he brought Kaneki back as Sasaki Haise. Arima had made it so that Kaneki wouldn't be *allowed* to forget himself. Eventually, Kaneki would go on to succeed Arima's title and vision, and in this, Arima lives on through Kaneki's will. Arima's scenes leading up to his death are rife with references to the flower as well, as seen [here]( and [here]( of these have in common that the people whose lives have been touched by Arima, like Take and Yomo, will always remember him and are profoundly affected by his existence especially now that they are tied to his last living link, Kaneki. The irony is that Arima hated himself, saw himself as an ugly murderer of the ghouls he wanted to save, and couldn't forget any of this even if he wanted to.", "You're right. Ui's lines are meant to relay the creeping realization that they've been playing right into *someone's* hands, that's it's *their* elaborate scheme, and that the CCG is basically a huge sitting duck as long as their games continue. The mistranslation doesn't completely ruin things, although in my opinion, the atmosphere is skewed since it's as if Ui's doubts are directed internally (\"This is just ghoul disposal, right? Our opening gambit.\") and that they have already definitively lost (\"The CCG was destroyed...\"). In reality, he's an astute person who's grasped the notion that the real enemy might be a tad more familiar than they initially thought.Regarding Juuzou's line: I just remembered that one of the CCG's laws as stated by Shinohara himself (TG, chapter 53) is that \"it is strictly prohibited for investigators to inflict more pain on a ghoul than necessary.\" Juuzou's offhand remark that he reminds himself of Shinohara right after is incredibly fitting. What a way to pass on the torch. He really has grown so much.", "There's doubt that Cersei ever truly loved her children in the way everyone thought she did. It always seemed to me that she loved the idea of what they could be if she could mold them to her image. Her values are related to power and security, and her children don't really provide that for her. Even if she had loved them in her own way, her mental instability near-completely obscured her maternal nurturing instincts. Also, Tommen effectively abolished the trial by combat just in time for Cersei's upcoming trial; whether he knew it would hurt his mother or not, it didn't matter to her. All she could think about is how she'd been backed into a corner because of his decisions, and thus resorted to her best plan to escape it. Tommen was her last living child at this point, and the fact that she chose torturing Septa Unella over physically staying by his side speaks volumes about her priorities. It's possible that she thought he'd be strong enough to deal with it, or that she wanted to believe so despite being fully aware it wasn't true. Her concerns regarding his safety were externally influenced, but she never once considered that her own actions could cause him pain and suffering in greater magnitude than anything else could. It could also be that she knew deep down that it was all over from the moment Maggy doomed her with that prophecy, and she was pretty much expecting Tommen to die like the rest of his siblings.Either way, she didn't know her own son enough to protect him from himself. Words spoken about the love she has for her children doesn't prove that she actually does. Her choices and manner of raising/neglecting them to her convenience tells me she never could, even if she desperately wanted to.", "I came across a few tumblr posts a while ago, one of which explored the [reason for all the one-sided relationships]( another that did well explaining [why Takizawa/Akira is as meaningful as Amon/Akira]( and another reasoning that the [three of them are best left as they are unless the plot requires either relationship to advance]( There are those who are already convinced that Amon/Akira is the valid and destined pairing, the corollary being that Takizawa/Akira is strictly platonic, but really - there is no way to prove that either is or will ever be the case.The most significant missing link here is what Akira is feeling *right now* and why. The elements we know for certain are that Takizawa is completely self-aware of and accepted his own feelings for her, and that Akira was romantically attracted to Amon at some point in the original TG. On the other hand, Amon's emotions regarding anything beyond duty and guilt have not been delved into, which is why if he suddenly were to decide he is in romantic love with Akira as of his chat with Touka, it would seem very shoehorned in. His stalwart dedication to save Takizawa from his own insanity is impressive and is a cut deeper than his affection for Akira on Rushima. I think when he intervened before Takizawa could seriously hurt or kill Akira, it was out of a need to bring Takizawa back to his senses just as much as it was to protect her, because Amon understood two things in that moment: (1) He could not afford to disgrace Papa Mado again by allowing his daughter to die, and (2) he could not allow Takizawa to do what would ultimately cause him to definitively lose himself in his madness forever. So far, the sole hint of Amon's possible romantic feelings for anyone at all was for Harima; when Akira was drunk and clinging on to him, he was thrown severely off guard and [the first person that came to his mind was Harima]( Akira herself seemed to gain clarity about where Amon's heart lay during the scene where he kiss-blocked her, and it's as if she attempted it for confirmation, [expecting to be rejected]( To Amon, both Takizawa and Akira are precious people he wants to protect with everything he has, because he's tired of having lost so many in the past. With regard to Akira's role in the relationships, her feelings for Amon were the point of focus in the original TG whereas the focus has turned to her complicated feelings for Takizawa as of :re (the Auction and Rushima arcs).Ishida's [repeated usage of parallelism]( when portraying the Takizawa/Akira side of the triangle is fascinating. I mentioned this before and here I am saying it again, but it's this subtle, read-between-the-lines aspect of their relationship that makes them particularly fun to dissect. Akira's flashback in :re chapter 95 where Takizawa walks away from her, and her \"What if I stopped you back then...?\" that follows immediately after is even more interesting because then the exchange exudes a *what-if* or *what-could-have-been* vibe, although she was in all likelihood referring to the time she couldn't prevent him from running after Amon. Because what *would* have happened then, if Amon suffered the ghoul experiment as intended, but Takizawa did not and instead was able to resume his normal life after the raid?The bottom line is that the bonds between the three are powerfully significant to one other, so any individual pairing is better off unfulfilled. The tragedy of them realizing that they are only as good as their own resolve to protect and live for the other while being too late to hope for anything more leaves a bittersweet taste that is just right for a series like Tokyo Ghoul.", "My mother is an , and I can say that we clash far more than we actually get along. When I was younger, I was somewhat envious of certain people around me who were able to share a healthy and supportive bond with their parents. Now, I fully understand that she and I are and will continue to be different, mostly due to how we perceive the world. She's much less accepting, however, and thinks that I am wrong or strange whenever we can't agree on an issue that we are discussing.I've noticed that she's terrible at taking \"no\" for an answer as well - she asks me something, and then raises a fuss when she doesn't get the response she wants. I tend to think that one should not bother asking a question if they aren't willing to deal with the actuality that \"yes\" and \"no\" are equally valid.

The reason she is even in her current predicament is because, as Take says, she willfully shielded Takizawa at the possible risk of her life - in that moment, his survival was more important to her than her own. The connection between her and Amon was something plainly established in TG, but what Takizawa meant to her was far more implicit.", "Shio is also explicitly described as being a relative of Hairu's, and is not necessarily her little brother unless they share the same parent. This is all probably something to do with the fact that the different Washuu breeding lines are associated with each of those last names, such as Arima or Ihei. Yusa's description outright mentions that as a Washuu branch family, the Arima name is used by a number of others that we presumably haven't met yet or never will.", "A hidden tally could be implemented to keep score of how often a player joins and then leaves before completion. Since it's based on time anyway, maybe the system can use a second timer to track how long in the person made it before quitting. An algorithm could potentially be built around these two factors, frequency and time spent before completion (or keystone depletion), per instance. The higher the result, the more of an opportunistic troll they may be.

He was crushed. He hated himself for having to resort to killing the one father figure in his life. After the war, Gintoki lived on trying to fulfill the promise they made and the legacy that Shouyou left behind, since those things were all he had left holding him up. He was scarred in the most profound way, and the fact that he rarely uses a true sword helps illustrate that. Everything he has ever done throughout the series is thanks to Shouyou-sensei's influence. Now imagine the shock on Gintoki's part if the man responsible for his outlook on life turned out to be the last boss, and if he is forced to kill him a \"second\" time. Part of the reason why I thought the masked man could be Shouyou-sensei is due to Oboro's line as he descended, what with the \"Your howls have reached the heavens,\" coupled with the amount of focus on his face. This is all theory talk, anyway. I have a suspicion that, at the very least, he might be someone Gintoki knows.", "Based on Ishida's ridiculous treatment of Matsuri and his general penchant for bringing back characters who supposedly died, people are simply guessing that Matsuri might still be alive as well.

So, always go with your first instinct. Even if it's a bad idea... Because bad ideas make good stories.\"I don't remember where exactly I saw this quote, though it was probably somewhere on tumblr. It explains itself. Everything about it makes me feel as if I've stepped in sewage. There is a difference between making a mistake despite calculations, and diving in headfirst into a situation with total disregard for the consequences \"just because.\" It suggests careless overconfidence and bad decisions, literally.* \"Don't fix what isn't broken.\"This one tells me that stagnancy is okay, that it's best to wait until things actually fall apart to build upon them again. As long as nothing explicitly broke, no progress would be made. I strongly disagree with this mentality because everything has the potential for improvement. That's how we move forward.Incidentally, there is one quote from the comments that I thought isn't as stupid as it seems: *\"Everything happens for a reason.\"* The saying has a spiritual/religious origin which is probably why some may have the knee-jerk reaction to dislike it, but I think it also depends on how \"reason\" is defined. For me, \"reason\" here is more attributed to the law of reaction, that every action is paired with an equal and opposite reaction. Not too many random occurrences and coincidences can be properly explained (although science is the closest to being able to do so), and sometimes the reasons for those don't really matter, even if they do exist.

Hell is where Takizawa's been and that's still where he is.Ishida torturing his characters is nothing new, but what for to this extent? I don't think he's quite done with Takizawa yet. Given that he survived the fight thanks to Kuro, there's probably a whole new world of agony waiting for him ahead. He himself states that he's not looking for redemption because it was never really within reach, but that he can live now for the sake of a certain \"someone else,\" and the process of doing that will be no cakewalk.Insane props to him for his reliability and determination.

As the planning stage draws to a close and I'm about to begin implementing, because a considerable time has already passed since I've started, I decide I don't like the way I had it before and end up re-drafting parts of it.

To clarify, my point of contention mainly concerns their seemingly desultory approach to QA, hence my last sentence. Mishaps due to bugs/glitches like the one from yesterday may have been avoided - if it requires little to no effort for players to sniff them out, then I want to assume that Nexon's QA testers can be more vigorous in their search as well, such that the glitches *rarely* make it to the published product. I understand that it is more than possible for this sort of thing to happen regardless, but not often.From my own experience, in addition to having seen so many players talking about how this and that are broken, I just think ample planning and testing by the Maple team prior to each release from now on, no matter how small, can bring down the number of cursory maintenance updates.

Matsuri being ass naked after bombastically proclaiming his love was absolutely intended for this. As such, it's kicking up a mild fuss that he was mishandled as a character and that his death might just be another fake-out, although I'm not sure what important role his would be in the story moving onward. I also think the translation would have reflected the innuendo better if it were worded as something like, \"And then Matsuri was *torn* to shreds.\"", "This chapter is Ishida's way of telling everyone that he's the ultimate Clown. The title says it all. \"Thumbs up\" for chapter 117. That's a number pun for <U+3044><U+3044><U+306A> meaning \"nice\" or \"great,\" and that's just amazing.It's understandable that we get a small fast-forward so that it leaves room for Kaneki and Amon's discussion to be revealed through flashbacks in later chapters, but I can't help but feel like certain developments were very rushed. This is Ishida we're talking about, however, so I presume the pieces will fall into place eventually.Still, Amon's interaction with Touka was unexpected, and it seemed like it was more of an opportunity to echo Touka's emotions for Kaneki who has yet to come see her, which parallels Amon's hesitation in going to see Akira. It makes me wonder if Amon is truly a part of Goat, because he has not been able to fully accept himself as either ghoul or human. He's still the same as a whole deep down despite the radical changes he's been forced to experience, and if anything, those radical changes on top of his past as an orphan with Donato are what threw him into a state of internal turmoil that he hasn't gotten over yet. He's long displayed a willingness to understand Kaneki, but it never meant that he would *readily agree* to what Kaneki had to say. It would've been more natural for there to be tension between the two of them before Amon agreed to stay for the time being. Even then, they might not share the same goals: Kaneki acts out of duty with the knowledge that although he is neither human nor ghoul, he can be the hope for the ghouls he stands for because his predecessors entrusted him with the role; Amon acts out of guilt and a desire for closure and justice, unable to pave a clear path for himself because he's caught between the loyalties to his human mentor and his ghoul father on a subconscious level, which also symbolizes his own struggle in trying to reconcile with his duality. And for someone who was depicted as being utterly devoted to saving the lives of his comrades, he seems fairly lax concerning the whereabouts of Takizawa and Kurona. It was an interesting moment when he tore off his prayer beads before, because it was as if he was metaphorically casting aside the mantle of passive savior to Takizawa in favor of becoming a fighter, [a knight]( what with the dropping of his kakuja-helmet.It was also interesting to see Take and Touka have varying opinions on how to get Akira to come out of her shell. The former suggests that meeting Hinami is key, while the latter suggests that it should be Amon. Both make some sense, but Akira is conflicted as is coming to grips with her situation and the fact that two people directly responsible for her father's death are right there. Adding one of those two to the mixture is nothing short of adding fuel to the fire; for the same reason Touka chooses to stay away until someone can break the ice, Hinami would be better off doing the same as this chapter has shown us that she isn't mentally prepared to deal with the confrontation yet anyway. Even Kaneki failed because Akira was hurt and confused by him. Letting Amon successfully handle the job would seem too easy and like a free pass to a relationship upgrade too soon. Akira's perspective hasn't even been explored yet, and people tend to forget that she herself confessed that she was romantically torn between Takizawa and Amon. Rather, I think the best person suited to coaxing Akira first is someone like Take, who is not emotionally tied to her in any way but is also an insider who can speak with her neutrally and as logically as possible.Well, that got long.

Here are some of my favorites:* Gintama* One Punch Man* Soul Eater* Deadman Wonderland* Tokyo Ghoul* Owari no Seraph* Kekkai Sensen* JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* Shingeki no KyojinThat being said, I definitely prefer the original manga to their anime counterparts.

But let's revisit [Kaneki's lines in chapter 119]( lost Hikari, and much like Mado, was swept up in his hatred of the enemy that stole his loved one from him. However, where Mado made no effort to hide this from even his own daughter whom he cared about in his own way (which influenced Akira to pursue her path as a ruthless investigator), Arata -- like Kaneki -- hid his true intent behind harmless smiles as if to protect his children from the reality of what he had to become for their mother. Thus Touka was able to grow into the silent sufferer she became, different than Akira yet still very much the same.All the while, Kaneki did in fact lose many that were important to him, like Hide, Arima, and the Qs, who happened to be people he bonded with through his \"human\" side, whether it was as human-Kaneki or as Haise. He nearly lost Akira too, someone he views as a mother figure, whom he went out of his way for in order to ensure her safety by prioritizing it as Goat's first mission.Yet he himself seems to deliberately ignore these points, especially the way the Qs are portrayed in that panel, as if they're an afterthought that he acknowledges but promptly shoves aside out of guilt. Unlike Arata and even Mado whose remaining important people (their children) were directly tied to the beloved they lost and were thus driven mad by vengeance, Kaneki's major losses are not directly related to Anteiku and the like -- he isn't quite out for revenge, but rather seeks strength so that he can protect them. Kaneki and Arata both went after raw power as though it would be the answer to their problems, but neither could figure out the simple fact that one man bearing all the burden means he will eventually collap"], "softlabels": {"E/I": 0.19322709163346613, "S/N": 0.20075757575757575, "T/F": 0.7642585551330798, "J/P": 0.8778625954198473}, "hardlabels": {"E/I": "I", "S/N": "N", "T/F": "T", "J/P": "J"}}

Though I disagree with his conclusion that punishment is acceptable according to \"proportionality\" as described by Rothbard, he very thoroughly outlines (with sources) the relevant underpinnings of a good libertarian theory on the matter. Currently, my position is that aggressions can only justifiably be responded to with force in the moment of their occurrence, which has some rather interesting implications. Self-defense, under that framework, constitutes a moral risk i.e. betting that aggressive action will continue into the immediate future unless stopped. Obviously that complicates matters somewhat, but thus far I haven't found anything to suggest that it would be self-contradictory.", "I find that the very idea of proportionality fails when one considers the implications of subjective value. You could forcibly confiscate all of thief's property and still consider it \"proportional\", given that you've disregarded his consent and are entirely dependent on the subjective valuation of damage as expressed by the victim. That's not my ultimate argument against punishment, but it does bring out an interesting point. I would say that torture is acceptable in a particular set of extreme defensive circumstances. For example, say a kidnapper did the whole bury-the-victim-with-limited-air thing, or a terrorist hid a destructive device etc. *If* you have strong evidence of a credible, immediate threat and *if* you have strong evidence that the person could stop that threat, I would consider torture as an option of last resort.

The same technology that allows cars and power tools can also be used for tanks and firearms. These days a person with access to a flash drive, a computer, and a good hardware store can create, with very little indication of intent, a potent explosive device capable of causing mass casualties. 3D printers have similar capacities, and weâ€™re only seeing the tip of the iceberg with that technology. Bottom line is, short of sending humanity back to the stone age, thereâ€™s no way to eliminate weapons availability or the associated risk.    What we can do, though, is minimize the risk by adopting comprehensive security strategies - anticipating risk and taking steps to prepare for possible attacks while maintaining productivity and societal function. This would reasonably include a form of gun control i.e. not allowing weapons in certain areas as determined by the proprietors and maintaining security staff to check everyone and everything passing through entry control points into the said vulnerable area. It could also include groups not unlike those in scuba diving, where an individualâ€™s skills are certified by one of several associations that maintain certain standards and give a reliable means of deciding whether or not to allow an individual to use certain equipment. Intelligence operations, on site surveillance, and crowd interaction by trained psychological analysts also undoubtedly have their place, again, depending on the location being secured and the needs of the proprietor. Like any other service sector of modern society, security is incredibly complex and must be constantly developing to best suit individual needs, of which there are (obviously) millions.    This is where the whole gun control vs. unrestricted access debate goes wrong. Itâ€™s not either or, nor is it some legislative hybrid of the two. A system wide solution is necessary, and that canâ€™t develop when a bunch of idiots in Congress (or state legislatures) are fighting an endless battle over who gets to force their simplistic, small minded views on everyone else. Attempting to outlaw weapons access or provide blanket, one-size-fits-all security is an absurd approach to the problem, as it is quite literally impossible for it to be flexible and adaptive. Similarly, unrestricted access to both weapons and vulnerable areas with no security plan is a catastrophe waiting to happen. Thereâ€™s just no winning with an all-we-have-is-a-hammer approach, as in the end it will inevitably degrade both security and productivity. If we want to solve this problem, we have to begin to think in comprehensive systems, as well as respect the rights of others to innovate and produce the necessary variety for a truly stable security apparatus.Edit: Formatting", "Post WWII (1951) Swiss Karabiner Model 1931The metal components were in great condition, around 90% finish and a shiny bore, but the stock was pretty beat up so I decided to refinish it.

Our modern equivalent of the Roman Empire is in decline and the power that it (and others like it) have held is bleeding out into society. Non-state actors now command influence, whether for good or bad, on a scale previously reserved only for heads of state as governments struggle to retain the financial viability and public support needed for their continued existence. Some have referred to this as the start of a neo-feudalistic period, which like its predecessor, will see a shift in power from the strong nation-states of the 20th century over to a more distributed network based model where peer-to-peer connections supplant many of the traditional hierarchical organizational structures. This shift doesn't mean downward civilizational trends either. The percentage of the global population that is undernourished or in extreme poverty has been cut in half just in the past 25 years, and those rates continue to fall as global GDP continues to rise. We now live longer that ever, and have seen sharply declining death rates from war, child mortality, and disease, especially in poorer countries. Additionally, advances in technologies like solar power, energy storage, aquaponics, and 3D printing point toward a future of increased decentralization (and resulting resilience) of basic human sustenance to the extent that even some catastrophic \"black swan\" events will lose their status as potential civilization enders. While some may see the push for government censorship and universal spying capabilities as evidence of a decline into tyranny and oppression, I see it more as a desperate attempt to hang on to power and control, even as the tipping point toward freedom has already been reached. The genie of peer-to-peer technology and cryptography can't be put back in the bottle, and every measure of censorship and spying is being defied by increasingly innovative countermeasures. Is there bad stuff going on? Absolutely. Will there be some sort of decline or collapse in the near future? Probably. Given the degree to which the global economy has been pushed out of equilibrium by the combined force of bad policy and cartelized business, it'll be like a rubber band reaching its limit and snapping back, which will be incredibly painful, but necessary to create real growth in the future. In spite of all the geo-political and economic interference, real wealth (not to mention knowledge) has still increased remarkably over the past few decades, so what we have to fall back on in the event of a massive global correction (otherwise known as a depression) is higher than ever before. The challenges going forward are still obviously huge, and there will always be plenty of cynics fretting about the loss of the status quo and blissfully ignorant people pretending it won't ever happen, but there will also be innovators and leaders working to tackle those challenges, and they're the ones that have brought human civilization this far.

It's entirely possible and, I would think, quite likely that if the group of women polled in the study were instead asked about principles of law after multiple classes highlighting state violence and the reality of fiat law enforcement, you would see some very libertarian ideas espoused instead. It really comes down to emotional or close personal reasoning and playing it safe socially versus group level reasoning and risk taking.

By all means, if some feature of a particular AnCap argument has a untenable premise presumed within, articulate it and I'll gladly take it into consideration. AnCap's don't necessarily say that society 'should' be organized a certain way. They have preferences about society, sure, but those are just personal opinions. The real argument put forth is that organizing society by coercive central planning is logically inconsistent. My criticism of utilitarian arguments has nothing to do with the character of their proponents. Likewise, the potential existence of flaws is also irrelevant. What I'm addressing is the underlying premise, which must be correct if the argument is to be valid. In any utilitarian argument made by an individual or limited group, that premise is utility, which is fundamentally based on the preferences of the individual(s). Given that there are individuals whose preferences are not included and thus who's utility is not considered, the utilitarian argument must be said to place the preferences of those making the argument as superior the preferences of everyone else. As a result, AnCap theory holds that utilitarian considerations, while completely valid as they pertain to an individual's life and peaceful activities, are utterly invalid in the political sphere, as politics consists of forcefully inserting oneself into the lives and property of others.", "It's pretty hard to mess up if you use a fine sandpaper and take your time.

It's nice to think that a particular sort of investment \"should\" be made, but keep in mind that there are billions of other people just like you who have their own ideas about what \"should\" be invested in. I should also point out that if an enterprise operating on the basis of consensual interactions (a free market) turns a profit, then it has, by the subjective determination of all actors involved, generated a net benefit (and at every step, no less). The possible length of investments corresponds to the amount of unconsumed resources available for enhancing productive capacity (and satisfying the current needs of those doing the enhancing) as communicated (in a free market, that is) through the price of money (interest rates). Given that each of us possesses unique knowledge of our own interests, self-interest is the only means available for reliably satisfying individual preferences. It is destructive only when satisfied through non-consensual interactions (violence), though I can understand the cultural opposition to its more shortsighted forms; in a tribal society, the insistence on so-called altruistic behavior functions as a simplistic form of investment (i.e. helping yourself by helping the tribe).

If you're referring to specific utility, e.g. let's all do X because I think we'll all benefit from it, then that's a qualitatively different type of utilitarian argument than what I've described thus far. I would argue that universal specific utility is incompatible with politics, as suggesting we all do X because it's beneficial relies on universal consent, otherwise the supremacy of a particular subset of utilities is re-asserted. As an example, if you say 'let's all do X because we'll all benefit from it', but some of the group members unflinchingly disagree and don't want to do X, you can then either a) take a voluntaryist stance and attempt to convince them while ultimately respecting their self-ownership or b) take a statist stance and force them to do X against their will, at which point you would be placing the utility of the majority (everyone does X) over the utility of the minority (some don't do X). If you're referring to a universal inclusion of general utility, I would argue that you're not actually making a utilitarian argument at all, but are instead doing utility analysis. If all general utilities are equal, then by definition they can't have overlapping domains. For example, my neighbor's utility can't be considered logically valid if extends to my being enslaved to him, and therefore must be limited to his own life and possessions. As with specific utility, I would argue that equality of general utility is incompatible with politics, as the general utility of a particular group (be it an oligarchy, majority of voters, or legislative body) is necessarily placed above the rest. I never said that an argument made by a single person automatically presumes them superior. I said that *utilitarian political* arguments presume the superiority of one will over another. To summarize more precisely, I'm arguing that any utilitarian argument that is not premised on equality of general utility must therefore be premised upon inequality of general utility, i.e. the supremacy of one will over another, and as the former is incompatible with politics, all utilitarian political arguments must presume the latter.Again, are you taking a voluntaryist or statist stance when it comes to societal 'design'? Taking a voluntaryist stance would mean incompatibility with the goldilocks principle (no optimum level of government), and taking a statist stance would mean incompatibility with equality of general utility.   What sort of 'should' are you referring to? I'm referring to the political utilitarian 'should'. It seems you may be referring to 'should' as more of a suggestion, i.e. we 'should' all do X if we can all agree that it's best. Well, if we didn't share at least a cursory agreement over the semantics of the english language, we couldn't be having this discussion.

(But dang it, I already have a novel in progress...)Damn, that's depressing. :) We only get into his twenties, but I might have to address that.Thanks again!", "This is my first critique here, so I hope I’ve got the tone right. All of this is meant to be constructive. :) I’m having a bit of trouble winding up an overarching critique, so I’ll just go scene by scene, giving my impressions and suggestions.**Scene 1:** What we learn here is that a couple is keeping vigil in the hospital for...someone. Quite honestly I spent the first few scenes thinking their kid was dying, which makes it a bit of a letdown (intensity-wise) when we find out it’s Morgan’s father, whom she doesn’t get along with for reasons we’re not privy to for a pretty damn long time. Why the mystery? Holding back the information (at least that they’re there to see her father - what happened to him, anyway?) tamps down the emotion more than heightening it, IMO. The dialogue about food doesn’t add anything we don’t already know, and it doesn’t sound natural. Unless you’re trying to show that Morgan and James are really uncomfortable around each other.**Scene 2:** Whoa, abrupt transition to questionably relevant flashback. Since we’re seeing their first meeting, I’m assuming James falls for her right away, but I’m not feeling it. We see Morgan playing with his friends’ dog (I agree with others that we don’t need to know the friends’ names, nor do we need to know that the Labrador is 3 months old) which makes her lower her (apparently ironclad) guard. But why does he care? Is Morgan hot? Is James turned on by women who let dogs lick them? What? I’m not really getting a “smitten” tone here. You don’t have to be all “her golden hair flowed over her beautifully full breasts and I felt my heart start to pound,” but since he doesn’t know her at all, having him appreciate *some* external feature or mannerism would sell the instant attraction a little better. Their first conversation is hardly the stuff of epic romance, either. TBH if I were Morgan I would’ve forgotten this guy’s name before he even walked away. I would suggest cutting that dialogue and concentrating more on showing us some of that lovely nerdy banter that pulls them together when they’re in the hospital waiting room. (Is Morgan a banterer? Most nicey-nice people aren’t.) Show us how James becomes intrigued by her and then decides to try opening her up. As it is, she lets him “see her” (I’m not quite sure what that means, btw - we don’t get a sense of the “real” Morgan by watching her clown around with a dog) then he holds her hand for a rather creepily long time, and then over a period of weeks they...date? I guess? Until he finally charms the name of her high school librarian out of her? Show us a little bit of this. Also, I’m not sure if this is your intention, but it reads like the early part of their relationship is just him wearing her down, which doesn’t make me care very much about whether they make it as a couple.“Professionally kind” sounds a bit like she works for an escort service. I’d suggest replacing it with something that plays up her guardedness, e.g. “her shield of kindness” (something like that would dispose of an adverb, too).**Scene 3:** I’m finding James slightly insufferable with the stilted Viking jokes, but hey, if Morgan likes him… We do get some sense of what their relationship is like normally, the banter and such they engage in, which is nice. But you could cut like half of this scene. We don’t need the back-and-forth about the nurse coming and the woman leaving and...yawn, I skimmed it. Oh, wait, that was the reveal that they’re here for her father! And Morgan’s angry about something, but we don’t know what! I would condense this way down and move it before the first flashback.**Scene 4:** Another scene where almost nothing is happening. Flashback. Photo albums. James had long hair as a boy, apparently. Wait, “Morgan, dear”? Whose head are we in again? The first person makes this POV switch disorienting. Nothing wrong with labeling each scene with its viewpoint character. Either that or make the viewpoint absolutely clear in the first paragraph.This might be a good time to talk about the focus of your story. So we’ve got Morgan, who in her POV scenes is pretty focused on her memories of her father, and James, who’s focused on his relationship with Morgan, but there’s no connection between the two POVs and therefore, the two main clusters of themes. And we don’t get to see through Morgan’s eyes in the reading present until practically the end of the story, when she’s in the ICU with her dad. I would seriously consider ditching one of your viewpoints - probably James’, since the heart of the story seems to be Morgan wrestling with her feelings toward her father. I suppose James’ scenes show us how Morgan’s dad can still fuck up her life and relationships long after the abuse has ended, but James is too passive to be very compelling as a narrator.**Scene 5:**  I can’t really see the point to this scene, other than to tell us James is a PhD of something your average reader would have to Google (and probably won’t). And that he and Morgan are stillllll waiiitingggggg and will be until the Vikings rise from their graves and reconquer northern Europe.**Scene 6:** Are they at their house? When are we in their relationship? This scene doesn’t tell us much about plot, character, or theme. He loves her? We know that. She’s a bit of a martyr and emotionally fragile? We also know that. My suggestion would be to cut it. The fact that she’s overcome her abusive childhood to become an attorney (or social worker?) is a nice nugget of characterization, but first we’d have to know she was abused, which we only suspect, because you’ve buried the lede so deeply.**Scene 7:** Still waiting. Still in the hospital. Morgan’s still a martyr. I’d cut this one too, or else merge it with Scene 5.**Scene 8:** Somewhere among these bits of relationship backstory might be a good place to bring up the fact that they’ve previously discussed having kids, and that Morgan was previously amenable to it. That way it would have more emotional impact when she changes her mind at the end. **Scene 9:** Dr. Eberhardt. What happens after this 24-hour deadline? Dad’s health insurance runs out and they toss him out on the street? Morgan has to pay for his care if she decides not to pull the plug? What are the stakes here, what sacrifices is she facing? Also, in scene 1 they’ve already been at the hospital for 2 days. Was Dad in surgery? How come his daughter hasn’t been given the opportunity to see him before now?**Scene 10:**  We get a sense here of Morgan as someone who thinks it’s very important not to be troublesome - good. IMO, what she says to her father doesn’t add anything to the story. We don’t care what James thinks about all of this: we’re wondering what’s between Morgan and her father, why she’s so conflicted. This might be a place where you could have her say something hateful - something she’d never dare say to her father when he was conscious. The word “deign” gives the impression that Morgan believes the nurses are her adversaries, which doesn’t jibe with her bringing them cookies and one of them making the effort to come out and thank her.Is it ethically sound for a nurse to try and influence Morgan’s decision like that? You might want to have Morgan be more surprised - even offended - that Ellen has crossed that line. Also, WTF, Ellen? You can’t give the guy a blanket without being prompted, but you can guilt his daughter into keeping him on life support?**Scene 11:** Mom’s funeral. It’s implied here that Dad had something to do with the death of Morgan’s mother (or am I just imagining things?) and that he has not been abusive toward Morgan before this. How old is she here? Pretty young, it seems like, but they’re letting her sit alone in the pew? Where’s Granny?I’d suggest showing us more of Morgan’s dysfunctional family well before this point in the story. Maybe Dad’s not coming home drunk and hitting her, but Mom’s got unexplained bruises, Morgan hears yelling after she goes to bed, etc. **Scenes 12 and 14:** By this point I’m just impatient with James’ ineffectuality. TELL HER TO PULL THE PLUG ALREADY, JAMES. The fight (or bit of one) that’s wedged in between these scenes comes out of nowhere. OK, so James doesn’t even remember what set Morgan off, but wouldn’t it be more effective if he did, and it was an event that had some connection to what’s going on in the reading present? Maybe she got the call about her dad, James wonders aloud why she’s even bothering to go see him, and she snaps. At the very least, ground us in a setting and time frame. Their discussion about having kids (or not) feels like a detour. This is a decision that carries a lot of emotional weight for people, but you haven’t brought it up before now. I’d suggest you either develop it more fully to show how much Morgan and James are losing (show Morgan being good with kids, show her and James idly talking about baby names) or get rid of it entirely.**Scene 15:** Morgan reminiscing about her favorite photos of her father. It’s really interesting that her best memories of her dad are static images of his past self - a self that is, presumably, redeemable. That would be a great theme to expand on, how she sees both him and herself as irredeemable in the present. This might actually be a better place to end the story than the next scene. Having Morgan break down while we’re reading from her POV - having her realize, finally and forever, that James can’t help her and he’ll never be able to - would be way more powerful than listening to more of his nattering on about it, IMO.", "Overall, the chapter gives me a clear sense of the relationship between Serra and Emilia (and Michael, which is pretty good considering we don’t even see him) and you make me believe that they would do anything for each other. Obviously I don’t have the big picture, but there’s enough detail and hints at backstory that I’m not lost. I like the reversal of the ending - definitely makes me want to read on. On to more detailed comments! Since we’re starting with a chase scene, I’d make the first paragraph punchier, breaking it up into shorter sentences, with less back and forth naming of the characters. The way it is, I’m not really getting a visceral or visual sense of the chase that’s happening. It seems like Serra would also be more focused on the visual of Emilia getting closer and closer as she gains on her than the auditory stimulus of the jingling sound (do you tell us what this is in an earlier chapter?) getting closer.Next couple paragraphs give me a clearer sense of the action, and we also get a window into their relationship, how close they are, without a lot of words. Very nice.This makes it sound kind of like Serra sat up, in contrast.I don’t love this. Words don’t really wilt. Her tone or her voice wilted, not her words, maybe?If you’re going to use these words, I need more of a sense here that they are creating a little bubble of tranquility amid what I assume is a pretty dangerous situation. What IS going on around them, anyway? (I’m picturing an urban environment.) Are there people around? If so, are they fighting? Running away? Concerned at all about the two women lying on the ground?Emilia furrowed her brow and opened in her mouth in a look of shock. And at last, she coughed up laughter until her voice rang in merriment. “You couldn’t even if you tried.”Why is Emilia shocked? Also, the description of her reaction seems overly wordy. Something like “Her eyes widened in shock. Then she coughed laughter until...” might flow better.I might move this section to *after* Emilia’s revelation that she’s the one who looted abandoned houses, etc. so it feels like more of a realization on Serra’s part.This feels a little purple, as well as slightly confusing. Is Emilia the sort who talks about herself in third person? I’m seeing her as more action oriented than poetic. You could have her just tell Serra what she went through in a more direct way.Since this is a quick action I’d shorten it: “Emilia slammed her forehead into Serra’s.” You don’t want it to take much longer to read than it does to happen.This is unnecessarily wordy, IMO. We know it’s a command, and the following paragraph shows us how intimidating she is.Is there some significance to the screaming bit, or is our unseen villain just being dramatic? It seems like kind of a hackneyed thing for them to say. To have the impact I think you’re going for, the villain really just needs to make their presence known. And of course we need to know that Serra and Emilia are scared of them, but you could easily do this through Serra’s reaction.", "Hi, Matthew Goode! (Or Rob James-Collier?)", "My husband's not involved other than the occasional \"So, how's the writing going?\" He's not a huge reader, and when he does read it's usually hard SF, high fantasy, or humor, none of which I write. I'm pretty happy with it this way. I wouldn't want him involved in any editing/critiquing capacity since he's neither a writing/publishing professional or part of my intended audience. I do think he sees my writing as pure hobby, on par with him gaming, while I see it as something I'd like to turn into a quasi-professional career. If I thought showing him my writing would change that mindset I'd do that, but since our tastes vary so much I worry that it would just settle him into it more firmly.", "Holy wow, I didn't even know there were 9 books in that series.

My challenge with fleshing this early stuff out more is that the story as a whole isn't about Frank's relationship with his father so much as the ways in which his ability to come back from the dead affect him. His relationships play into this, though, and I'll definitely take your comments on board. I'm in the midst of draft #3 and I'm trying to tighten the focus to the idea that every time Frank dies, he loses a life, i.e. some important part of himself (relationships, aspirations, values). The main conflict of the story is going to be him trying to break that cycle. The primary casualty of his first death is his relationship with his father, so I'll need to build up what he's losing in as few words as possible. Kill me now, lol.", "Eh well, I've written two drafts with a beginning, middle and end. :) What I meant is the story probably doesn't have the focus it needs.

It's always helpful to have people point out the plot holes. :)I'm not sure this would strengthen the story. We don't have an explanation for what happens to us (our soul, consciousness, whatever) after we die. People believe various things, but none of us know for sure. I'm looking at Frank's immortality in much the same way. He'll probably never know why he resurrects. He could try and find that out, but that would be a much different story (maybe one people would be more interested in reading, but not the one I wrote, lol).There are two kinds of people in the world... :)", "Right?

Then I dropped out and played in bands for a few years. I was getting sick of waiting tables and being poor when I read an article about a local web development company where they had Nerf gun fights in the office and everyone who worked there was under 30. I decided that's what I wanted to do, went to community college for an associate's degree in digital something-or-other, and a couple years later got a job at that same company. Got laid off, went back for my bachelor's, and now I work in higher education.All this to say that your career path will probably take turns you don't expect and might go down a few blind alleys, and that's OK.

I've been fortunate in that my timing was off in hitting the usual milestones. So instead of entering the professional workforce in 1999-2000 like I was \"supposed\" to, I stretched out my second adolescence until after the dot-com bust had ended. Instead of buying a house in 2005 and ending up underwater, I bought in '09. Luck plays a huge part in financial success, and I agree with the article that much of our generation has had to deal with structural challenges in ways that the cohorts on either side haven't.The part about being afraid to quit your job and follow your dreams resonated with me, but I think that's a pretty common problem, at least for people who aren't independently wealthy. Either you DWYL and are broke and anxious because of that, or remain stuck in your soul-sucking career and have health insurance. (That's an oversimplification. There are lots of people, including myself, who maintain a decent balance between stability and creativity.)During my mid to late 30s I've gone through periods of dissatisfaction, but they are always followed by reconciling myself to reality and recommitting to modest but steady progress toward my personal goals (there's that ol' Gen X pragmatism). However, I've also got only one child, a great partner, family members living nearby that help out, and am financially stable. I have no idea how I'd deal with a real crisis at this point in my life, and I do worry about my parents aging.", "I try not to think about it too much. Occasionally I'll play out scenarios in my head where I or certain loved ones have died.

I'm sorry that happened to you.", "I totally agree, as long as low rises don't come back in along with the flares.", "Thanks very much! I'm glad the WWII-era vibe comes through. And since 2 people so far have flagged \"fam\" I'll be taking that out. :)I needed to keep the word count down and most of the important stuff with Frank's family of origin (aside from Addie) happens before he goes to war, hence the lack of family reunion scene. A question about your comment re: Frank's dad: Stuart's behavior is meant as extreme overprotectiveness, which manifests as harshness and rigidity (he is, after all, a midwestern farmer in the 1930s-40s, so he's not wearing his emotions on his sleeve).

My students have come from different socioeconomic and international backgrounds. Here is what I have noticed:* Male students are the most unprepared of the students I encounter. They are more disorganized, less likely to pay attention to requirements, and more likely to rush their writing. Male students also, in general, have inferior writing to the female students I encounter. At the community college level I have encountered far more mentally challenged men than women.* Male students rarely seek writing help, even when required to by instructors. Now there is a selection bias here: even when required to come, the requirement is rarely more than a few points. I imagine most men would simply choose to lose those few points then attend a session, whereas women are far more likely to take that opportunity. But this shows they are less likely to take an opportunity with long-term benefits because of short-term inconvenience.* Male students who seek help are often the worst clients, including, and sometimes especially, international students. They are hostile, disinterested in interacting during sessions, and far more likely to argue against any suggestions given to them. My own personal method for tutoring sessions with male students is excessive flattery. Any suggestion that they may have done something incorrect is likely to shut them down. I donâ€™t know if this is cultural or in response to their prior experiences in school. However, I do notice international students from collectivist cultures, like China and Korea, do not act this way (note: our Chinese students were the most likely to cheat and plagiarize their papers, but they werenâ€™t hostile).* All students, male or female, who say they donâ€™t know how to write well usually say they are good at math. The difference going forward is that the male students are more likely to say they wonâ€™t need it â€“ even if they plan to go to graduate school in the liberal arts! This suggests that, barring personal ability, men donâ€™t believe they need to write well.* Male students are far more likely to come in with papers that donâ€™t follow the assignment, not just grammatical errors. They are also more likely to come in asking for help less than an hour before it is due (and usually only because they are required).* Now my coworkers: at the university level they were half male, half female. At the community college level (where I am now) they are all male. The men were more likely to skim the paper and give less instruction. Men were far less likely to work with male tutors, and reacted much worse to criticism from male tutors (they are more direct, and use less flattery).That said, most male students are great and I enjoy working with them. The chances of encountering an unprepared or hostile male student is simply higher. Equality doesn't mean you give each the same amount - but give them equal opportunity. Just like we would invest more in poor community, we should probably invest more in our male students. They need it so much more - but the investing has to be done much earlier. I'm afraid that a lot of my male students are beyond help without significant one-on-one tutoring or a major life changing moment in which they care more about their education.", "I've been told I come off as an  on the surface.", "With Verizon I was charged 25 cents every MB I went over.

For one thing, I was trying to go off my meds at the same time that I was playing LB. While I function very well on them, there's a certain emotional flatness I've always worried a lot about because I take them. I felt they kept me shackled down at the time, and I wanted to feel like a more independent, stronger person who's not limited by them. So I gave them up for a bit.It didn't go well. Emotionally I swung like crazy (which lead to some very strong positive connections to LB, honestly), but ohhh man, my ADHD really kicked in... There's a certain level of mindlessness that I can safely classify as a byproduct of ADHD and not just me being forgetful, and it was springing up so often. The point where I knew something was legitimately wrong with me was the worst; it was so simple, but it really kicked me in the head: I looked at a door saying \"PULL\" while I was pushing on it for about 5-10 seconds. The experience was so vivid I can physically feel it; every second my mind was saying \"pull it,\" but from an action standpoint I wasn't making the connection that what I was doing previously was obviously wrong. Despite this stark red message glaring at me- and my mind clearly processing it as \"PULL\"- I couldn't something so obvious, and so I stood there leaning on it for a good while. Like I was a broken automation.It was such awful shit; bit by bit, stupid thing by stupid thing I got really depressed over being such a wreck, felt inadequate and started skipping some classes.Furthermore, I had a weird social life, and it felt like I had a lot of splits in how I acted with people. By myself I'm calm and very introspective, someone who craves some sort of art or stimulation. But with friends I don't get to be that most of the time, and with people who I don't know, I get very anxious and self-conscious. So with friends, I end up very... Excitable, nutty, and such. I know that if I'm one on one with certain really close friends/family/significant others I get incredibly warm and affectionate, but it's so, *so* rare that I get to do that... I feel like I've only been really, really true to myself to a very select few people in my entire life. I've felt disingenuous and awful about this in the past. As if no one knew me.It was what I was dealing with while I played LB, and I've always seen Mio's route in a ridiculously symbolic and personal way because of that. Mainly, I don't see Midori as any sort of separate entity of Mio; she is Mio. That's a bit obvious, considering she's just a part of her psyche, but the entire idea that they're fundamentally the same person vying for reality really hits me hard.Midori isn't bad. People like Midori. Even Riki, who antagonizes her, doesn't even really hate Midori by the end. But he doesn't accept her, and Mio- deep down- doesn't really accept her either; she wants to be herself, enjoying her sort of romance in poetry by herself, having friends but keeping somewhat distant. (That itself is something else that I latch onto with Mio; Midori identity confusion aside, she seems so comfortable in her solidarity without shunning other people. I really admire that.) Even though Midori is a state of personality for Mio that might be socially 'correct,' Mio isn't fulfilled. And when they started mentioning that they had to suppress Midori with medication, it shook the hell out of me.It's on a lot of levels that I get very attached to this character who's probably as \"minor\" and unconnected to the greater story as possible. The idea that someone might get me for who I deep down might be, even if I'm not 'right' or what others want, gives me some sort of hope that someone will really deep down accept me for all the dumb shit and embarrassing parts of me... It's a kernel of optimism. I hold onto it and that ending scene a lot. Cause sometimes I'm worried I'll just say fuck everything and seagull the shit away from where I live because I'm sick of my surroundings, but I know I've just gotta be patient and I'm sure I'll find someone who'll swim after me. Not only that, but it let me feel that having different ways of behaving around people is still 'me,' and it calmed me way down. As long as I'm not being deceitful, I'm okay, y'know? I can be social and it's not necessarily a denial of myself or to anyone or anything, it's just... Me being me.Of course, the biggest problem is that the part of me that wants to break out all the time - my ADHD, my Midori - isn't something that's beneficial to me, nor can I whisk it away. It's not something that's a Jekyll and Hyde thing, it just creeps into my few little actions that get me pissed off at myself. And unlike Mio, it's something that my deeper emotional side WANTS to embrace rather than the other way around. It's a mental place where I can indulge in my spaciness and introversion if I want. But I can't do it or I'm practically a danger, trapped in a state of idiocy that I can't fight without having to embrace a dulled side of myself. Almost as if my ADHD's defeated me, that in my own story it's managed to lock me away instead.But... That's okay. I don't have a clear key ending where my issues are all solved by the end, but stuff like Little Busters reminds me that sometimes as long as I'm content, everything feels solved, and that's the sort of thing that lets us be happy through our troubles. It's why I love key and it's why I love Mio and her route. I'm not perfect, but I know who I am, and it's me; I should embrace me as me.", "Huh.  here and it's the opposite; that only happens with very close people or with no one.

She was violently arrested and thrown in jail for not properly signaling a lane change. We have to consider the fact that these types of incidents in which police target and mistreat POC are far more common than we'd ever like to admit. That experience is further amplified in the South, where racial tensions are higher than just about any other region in the country. Sandra Bland, as a woman of color, had every reason to fear the police before the incident even happened. Then, when she was arrested, she repeatedly asked the officer why, and he repeatedly ignored her requests for a valid reason, and eventually threatened to tase her if she didn't comply. Imagine the fear she must have been experiencing in this situation: arrested for no reason, threatened when she asked why she was being arrested, and then dumped in a jail cell. It wouldn't be farfetched to say that she must have been absolutely terrified. If just one racist cop's word was enough to get her thrown in jail for something as stupid as failure to signal, she surely must have been feeling as though her situation was completely hopeless. We think, \"Oh, they would have released her! No big deal!\" But put yourself in her shoes for a moment and imagine what she must have been thinking. This cop very likely targeted her and treated her the way he did because of her race. What else might the police do to her? What impact might her arrest have on her job, her friendships, her family life? If the police were willing to disregard protocol and target her for her race in the first place, how could she know that they would actually release her at all? How could she know that they wouldn't try to charge her with something she didn't do, or keep her in jail for an extended period of time?

We are able to track where he was on a given day because he wrote so many letters, but I never recall seeing any references to coffee in any of the thousands of letters I read. The 40-60 cups of coffee thing is incredibly dubious in my honest opinion. I don't believe it is true, and I won't until I see a legitimate source that doesn't link back to the same book about Paris cafÃ©s that was written in the last few decades. He was far too concerned about what he consumed to regularly drink that much coffee, as far as I can tell. I have never read in any biography or compilation written by other Voltaire scholars - the ones who have read basically everything he ever wrote, like Theodore Besterman - anything corroborating this coffee tale, either. I think it might just be a myth, like a lot of things surrounding the guy.As for where to start with Voltaire - I'd actually say to go with a biography first. For a casual reader who wants to see the funny side of Voltaire, I'd recommend Ian Davidson's biography, although I warn you that he seems to idolize the man quite a bit and doesn't always draw attention to his hypocrisy. For a fun read, though, it's quite a good biography that covers everything you need to know and is just...a very, very fun read. After that, Candide is the classic that I think everyone had to read in high school. If you understand any French, I'd actually recommend reading it in French - it's a quick, easy read, and what's fun about the French language is that it hasn't changed much at all since the 18th century. I think Candide could be easily understood by someone with 2 semesters of university French under their belt. It's a giant parody of Leibniz, so go into it with some basic knowledge of him, too.After that, his Dictionnaire philosophique is a good way to see if you dig his kind of humor. There's a lot of sarcasm in there. It's basically a giant book in which he shits on the establishment and thinks himself superior for it. Which I don't necessarily disagree with.I'm biased, but I really like his letters. Theodore Besterman compiled thousands of them and the books are available on google books, for the most part. A lot of them aren't translated, but spend some time reading the ones that are. They're incredibly fun...but maybe that's just me thinking that. The letters are like a fun puzzle, sometimes - he used codenames, codewords, and all sorts of misdirection so he could talk about what he wanted to without getting in trouble for it (which only worked sometimes). The letters really give insight into who he truly was, all of his insecurity and eagerness to please. His correspondence and relationship with Frederick the Great is beautiful, and Frederick himself was just a fascinating person. I think Voltaire can't be fully appreciated until you examine the world he lived in and the history of western philosophy he was building on. I have to admit that even though I was giddy every time I got to hold an original Voltaire letter up to the light to examine the watermarks on the paper, I find myself identifying far more with Rousseau, his enemy.", "Nothing beyond friendship that we know of. Rumors abound, however, about Voltaire and Frederick the Great (at the very least, they were flirtatious in person, although Voltaire tended to be playful in this way, and some accounts imply that he might have been a little bisexual...evidence almost overwhelmingly suggests that Frederick was gay). No solid evidence, though. In my personal and not-at-all-100%-verifiable opinion, I don't think it went beyond playful flirtation between him and Frederick, and nothing romantic happened between him and Catherine. There's just nothing to suggest the latter.", "He never married! He and his niece were together until his death, basically, and neither of them wanted to get married. They knew it was kind of socially unacceptable. Their love, judging by their letters, was a lot more physically-based than was the love between Voltaire and Emilie, which appeared to be a lot more intellectual. Voltaire and Emilie were intellectual equals, whereas Voltaire and his niece ultimately feels a lot more predatory, a relationship between a successful older man and his family member he was able to almost groom, in a sense. As you can probably guess, I find a lot more of interest in the Emilie-Voltaire relationship.", "This is one of my favorite movies! I love this scene so much.", "Haus of Gloi Haus Birthday!

The Salon des refusÃ©s was incredibly popular, too. The official Salon was a huge event for the general public, and Impressionist artists began to show up there in the late 1800s, too. Several of the Impressionist painters were celebrities decades before the 20th century began.", "Of course I did...this is me making an informal reddit comment about my personal conclusions about Voltaire after having studied him closely, having examined his intimate letters for a long time. I'm credited as a source on biographical pieces on the man. I was quite clear on my own feelings and always used the word \"I\" to indicate where I was inserting my own conclusions. That being said, nothing I said was inaccurate. He WAS an insecure man, and he WAS incredibly concerned with what others thought of him, and he WAS a very ingratiating person. This is all well-documented in his own letters, which I invite you to peruse yourself. These are facts that you will find in any biography of Voltaire. One day, he would proclaim someone the best person in the world, and the next, after they argued, he'd write a letter about how he always knew they were a fool. He always knew his audience and he was an excellent manipulator, and he took a lot of things very personally, which could hurt him. All that being said, I find myself fascinated beyond words by the man, and I can't even explain how much I value the experience I have.

Obviously, do the assigned reading before the lecture. Turn off your phone and laptop, take written notes and pay attention during the lecture. Review notes/powerpoint/lecture materials after lecture. Make sure you do relevant practice problems right after the lecture. You can even do these after the assigned reading or during the assigned reading (some textbooks have in-text problems, or you can just read 1 section and do the problems for that section, then go on to the next, etc.). I used to take a shit-ton of notes. Almost to the point where I was re-writing the textbook. Got B's in my science courses. Decided to stop, you know why? Because you can't have notes on a test (with the exception of a few classes, but typically this is the case). You need to make sure all the info is in your noggin and you are able to recall it. Instead of taking a lot of notes, really read slowly and pay attention to everything you are reading. Watch videos on the topics you are learning about. Be able to draw diagrams from memory (I was able to do this by first watching a Khan academy video on the concept and drawing the concept with the narrator, then I was able to draw it on my own). I don't take any notes now. If I don't feel confident, I just re-read the chapter or whatever and re-do practice problems. I went from being a B science student to an A one by doing this. I also don't make quizlets/flashcards anymore. I learn the concepts to the point where I don't need to find ways to memorize vocab and whatnot because I have deep understanding of the material already. Note-taking, in my opinion, is only effective if it aids you in memorization. If it is distracting you from the material at hand (which is what used to happen to me), then don't take notes.

It covers a lot of aspects of the anime/Naruto universe pretty well without spoiling much at the same time.* Naruto and Sasukes friendship/rivalry; You can see both how they have grown to be friends over time, but at the same time competed against eachother to become stronger.* Naruto and Sasukes individual personalities; You can see how much Naruto strives to create bonds because he grew up with none, and how much he cares about the bonds he makes. Meanwhile, Sasuke only strives to reach his goal which is basically to become stronger. This episode doesn't focus too much on why he wants to become stronger, but it easily demonstrates that the death of his family is what created this need. Not only that, but it shows the willingness to break any bonds he has made after that loss, so he can achieve his goals.* Demonstrates the extent of which ninjutsu can be used; Although  it doesn't explain how ninjutsu works, it shows the variance in the jutsus that can be used as well as how powerful they can be.* You can get a pretty good idea of the power of both the sharingan and the kyuubi. You can see Sasuke's power grow with the third tomoe, and Naruto's power with Kurama's chakra.* It shows various aspects of the anime itself is; it has intense (both emotionally driven and power driven) fight scenes as well as Naruto's talk no jutsu, each character has their own individual backstory that comes into play, talks about bonds that are made and are lost, etc. It even has the infamous flashbacks.* Leaves with a really good cliffhanger, in my opinion.To me, this sums up Naruto pretty well.

I've seen how they limit themselves and make the same mistakes all the time. So, I constantly work to seperate myself from that, as well as help my angsty little brother (lol) grow past it, and teach him that he cannot limit himself and his abilities.

I tend to be extra sensitive to this anyways (from what I'm told), but it still annoys me.

So I would need someone who understands the feelings, even if it is difficult to accept, without making it about themselves, as was mentioned in the following sentence.For example, my ex would express his views about our future, which weren't exactly *wrong*, but they just didn't make sense and he didn't take my side of things into consideration at all. Times I would express my line of thought and how I feel, he would turn it around and make it seem as though I am personally attacking him.

I already work in one, although I work more in the background, away from the kids mostly, and very minimal hours. It's what introduced me to the whole idea though, and I honestly love what I'm learning. To me its basically learning child psychology, and how to work with them. Definitely requires a lot of problem solving, critical thinking, and an open mind when dealing with the children, as well as the parents.

From what I've seen, when people end up being in the wrong and they just move on without any comment on the matter, it's just rude. It can be hurtful, even if they plan to correct the matter by their actions. The choice to not apologize tells me that their sense of pride or ego is what they value more. So a sincere apology to me is basically the person acknowledging that they are wrong, followed by actions that prove the words to be true. This tells me that their relationship with me is more important than their pride. Of course I apply this to myself when I'm wrong as well.Basically, an apology for a fault is like an acceptance of constructive criticism.", "I can totally understand where you're coming from.

She has a strict sense of values, and of what she likes and dislikes, and I am more lenient and open to all sides and opinions usually. She will definitely take action when she disagrees.

Of course there are people who don't care, but it's a socially conditioned rule to be conservative about life and prevent the deaths of others around you. There is absolutely so much you can do if you want to be friends with a girl. You guys can talk. You could ask a question. You could ask for a book recommendation. You could discuss how busy your days were. You could see if her views about the world differ from yours. You could ask if she's into volunteering at co-ops and stuff. You could show her a really adorable cat video. Or discuss the quality of the latest movie releases. Or even share a moment about the cafeteria food. Idk are you a student? Basically you can find countless ways to initiate a conversation by being mindful of the fact that you know so little about her, and basically get curious. Particularly if you guys are in the same school, I feel like there's almost no excuse to be strangers. You guys go to the same school! What a very fun time. This is the only time in your life where it is generally a big guarantee that you two have concerns that you both share: classes, teachers(that suck/or are amazing), cool people, weather, food, commute, midterm weeks, cool spots on campus. There's simply too much to even bother to list. Imagine if she was just some random in the grocery store. Then it would be wrong to assume you guys are so similar. She could be worried about her finances, or her exercise routine, or her old pal is giving her a headache. You guys have no shared experience like *school*.As for the autistic guy, I honestly wouldn't sweat it. Like you said, he's autistic. I don't see how you can feel outcompeted by him. But then again I do, because he's actually talking to her and youre not. She may even go on dates with him. But I don't know why that should bother you because you said you don't like her like that. I get that you feel thankful to her, but preventing someone from suicide may not be best reciprocated with friendship. Those two are not the same. Of course friendships can spout out of nowhere, but I think you may be misreading kindness with politeness. Politeness is the right thing to do. Kindness is from the heart. A lot of guys misread the two from girls when girls really are just being polite. They're being appropriately supportive, but it means very little to them, because girls are very emotionally advanced beings. They can make guys feel things. But yeah. Good luck man. You sound like you're experiencing very severe urges and a lot of repressed sexual desires. Not to type you or anything. But release the tension at least. And remember, don't hold her accountable for your life just because she stepped in once. She saved your life, but it doesn't mean anything sexually or even platonically.

If not, they may not even react that strongly to what you have to say. It may not even surprise them the least bit. If you are a loose butt confessing to a tight butt, then there may be a chance that the tight butt may react with grand gesture. If you are a tight butt confessing to a loose butt, you may be frustrated that you may not be properly understood or the depth of what you confessed isn't being interested or even pleasantly surprised that the loose butt did not make such a big deal about it and loves you all the same.But if you are similar butts, it is likely you two will behave similarly around the issue.", "1.

Personally it makes sense to me to NoFap as a MGTOW, because as a result you are taking the power away from your addiction to women. Women leech from you money, time, IQ, and energy, and in my opinion PMO does much of the same including hormonal changes by heightening a man's estrogen receptors. If you are PMO, think about the data consumed and electricity bill and time spent dedicating to worshipping a woman's body. In any case jacking off is better than settling down in a LTR, but in light of going your own way, true MGTOW to me seems to be focused on desensitizing yourself to the seduction of women and women's values which are stereotyped in porn's 6 pack abs 12 inch cock 6 ft tall 6 figures, not to also mention the trending cuck category nowadays. In many ways NoFap and MGTOW have very similar values involving the inner strength of men and men's self preservation and self fulfillment. It would be exciting to me to see the NoFap community and the MGTOW community to seek solidarity with one another, not only because they are a bigger pool of thought, but that most in NoFap foolishly seem to be doing it thinking holding their semen will get them their first girlfriend.

They take turns being DM &amp; player whenever a character dies. The very first series (Solomon) is very good.Hardcore Heroes - Neal auditioned a bunch of people for a show, and whenever one of them dies they leave the show permanently. This is probably my favourite show since Rollplay - the players are all highly competent and great roleplayers. Watch the first few episodes and you'll see what I mean. Recently, a character from Dicing with Death has been appearing on this show as well.Theres also Misscliks, which Gen founded along with Anna (Geoff's wife) and a co-worker Steph.

Not trying to discredit anyone's problems here, but I think a big part of it is that pretty much all FAer's suffer to some extent from depression/anxiety, and everything that encompasses. So they're going to have a very poor view of themselves that might not necessarily align with the reality of the situation.It sounds cliche, but I think if you're able to break out of depression/anxiety and the FA mindset, it really is like a veil being lifted off your head. I look back on all those years, and I'm just wondering, \"What the fuck was I thinking?\" I just feel like a lot of the things I saw as a problem are so inconsequential, or I'm just viewing them in a totally different light.But saying that to somebody who is still in that depressed and FA mindset probably isn't going to work, which brings us back to the original dilemma I guess. For me, I guess I was lucky in the sense that I had a brother who grilled me and really got the point across - I had to change my \"shitty attitude.\" But the bigger part of it I think, is just having that desire to improve yourself despite your shitty circumstances, and understanding you're going to go through a lot of things that will hurt, make you uncomfortable and outright challenge your whole self-perception along the way.I'm not saying you have to go out and be a casanova, or cure cancer or something... But really, what life comes down is trying to maximise your personal happiness - pursuing the things that make you happy. If life deals you a bad hand, I can understand why it might be disheartening to live under those circumstances, but in the end, doing that will *not* make you happy. It'll be comfortable, but ultimately unfulfilling.

It'll also let you explore a lot of different authors and figure out what you like. I'm not sure what genres you are interested in, but some suggestions:- Anton Chekhov -My personal favourite. Russian playright and short story writer, considered one of the greatest short story writers to ever live. Sort of a later Russian realist. He can write about a general situation but end it with a 'bang' by describing the overall image/impression of a scene, instead of relying on a twist or some sort of shocking revelation. Try out 'Huntsman' (you can read it online), and you'll see what I mean.- Raymond Carver -Contemporary American author. Give 'Cathedral' a try. Has a very straightforward and uncomplicated style of prose. He admired Chekhov a lot, and you can see his influence in Carver's writing. I'd probably start here.- Haruki Murakami -Japanese author, he's very popular right now. Another good choice to start with because of his uncomplicated prose. Some common themes in his writing are the loss of a woman, journeys of self discovery and the metaphysical. I really like the story 'Tony Takitani.' It's from a collection called Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman.- Vladimir Nabokov -A Russian author, but he's most famous for his novels written in English, especially the controversial Lolita. His writing style is always very pretty, even if he's writing about something disturbing. He uses a lot of alliteration and word play, and likes to hide things within his writing (either plot related, or jokes and digs.) I haven't explored his short stories, but 'Symbols and Signs' is supposed to be very good.- Sci-fi -I haven't explored this much, but take a look at the winners of the Hugo and Nebula awards for science fiction.After that you can move onto lengthier novellas and then finally novels.If you like non-fiction, start with smaller books that'll give you an overview over a particular topic.

I would highly recommend you check out the pointers in the sidebar for dehydrated skin and build a routine from there. A good place to start is with a good moisturizer topped with an occlusive to lock in moisture, like Vaseline or Aquaphor. I bet that a lot of the \"aging\" skin around your eyes is just dehydrated, and a lot of your fine lines would go away with rehydration! Also, I'm worried about you using tweezers to dig out hairs on your upper lip. This sounds like it's damaging your skin and could lead to other issues like hyperpigmentation that are more difficult to treat in the long run. Is it an option for you to get rid of all the hairs at once with something like waxing or threading? Could you maybe use a little concealer on the dark spots where hair is growing in until they're long enough to be plucked? As for sunscreen, generally \"face\" sunscreens are a little more cosmetically elegant, meaning they sit on the skin better and don't feel as heavy as body sunscreens. This also comes at a higher cost most of the time. This isn't to say you can't use a face sunscreen on your body, but it would be kind of wasteful if it's something pricier. You definitely could use a body sunscreen on your face and body if you find it works for you. There are also all in one moisturizers with SPF that are a good option for face. Just make sure that whatever you use, you're using 1/4 teaspoon of sunscreen for your face. Good luck to you!", "Who the hell drinks that much juice in one day?!

I've found that flowy tops need to have a v-neck or show more chest in order to look right, whereas higher neck tops only really work if they're fitted. The bodysuit trend is really flattering on hourglasses. The main thing I try to stick to is always making sure my clothes are fitted around my waist--otherwise, if clothes just flow straight from my bust (big) to my butt (big), I just look boxy.

You can look into the curly girl method for more info. The idea is to hydrate hair and rid it of buildup so that it looks curlier and healthier, but it's good for damaged hair too and you don't necessarily have to have curly hair to try it. At the end of the day, the only way to get completely rid of damaged hair is to cut it off. However, there are things you can do to improve the appearance and manageability of your hair. If your hair is mushy, stretchy, or gummy, it probably needs protein. Using a treatment like Aphogee 2-step would probably help. If your hair feels stiff and brittle, and snaps rather than stretching, it needs moisture and you could try deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, or incorporating a leave-in cream conditioner while your hair is wet to lock in moisture.

All in all I'd say I'm about 75-85% dairy free. I didn't do this for my skin per se, more for the lactose intolerance, but I'd say I've seen a little improvement in my skin, too, starting maybe 3 months in. I wasn't a heavy milk drinker or dairy eater before, though. I have a roommate who used to drink 4-5 glasses of milk a day and her skin got drastically better after she realized she was sensitive to lactose and cut it out. I think the result you'll get from cutting dairy depends on how much is in your diet to begin with, as well as your own body chemistry and how your skin reacts to the dairy. If you think cutting out dairy will help, try making little changes, like switching from cow's milk to soy or almond and avoiding buying yogurts/cheeses/ice cream. Personally, I've found avoiding dairy to be easiest if I don't keep the products at home, where I eat most of my meals, but allow myself to have a little on occasion while I'm eating out. Moderation is key. I think that even if your skin reacts negatively to dairy it won't hurt you to have a little butter or chocolate, especially if it's occasional and you aren't lactose intolerant/allergic/vegan. Start by keeping a diary and see what foods bother you, because you might find that dairy has no correlation with your skin quality but sugar/simple carbs/processed foods do.", "ScA, I have a random question for you: I'm 19 and have always wished the ends of my brows were lifted just *ever so slightly*. I have a naturally pretty straight brow and have to draw them in to get them to have the arch I want. I like the way that I look when my hair is pulled back tight enough to lift my face a bit, or if I put my fingers on my hairline near my temple and lift up slightly. Similar to the effect that those face tapes that drag queens use to lift their brows give (hey Miss Fame), but a little more subtle. I'm talking like no more than a few mm of lift here.I just learned that a botox brow lift only requires ~2-5 units per side. Considering I'm young, not looking for a dramatic lift, and don't really have hooded eyes I can't imagine needing more than 4-6 units total, which at my area's typical rate of $12-15/unit equals a total cost of less than $100, excluding consultation fees and things like that. Regardless, this is totally within budget for me in the near future.  Is it stupid for me to be considering getting botox being as young as I am? I'm not really seeking this for anti-aging (though I would eventually like to start getting preventative botox between my brows done since very deep 11 lines are hereditary/already forming for me), mostly just for aesthetic purposes. Do you guys think the risks of a way over-arched brow outweigh the benefits? If the botox wears off and I decide I don't want to keep getting it done, is there a possibility my face won't be exactly the same as before?

Take some computer science/programming courses, if that's what you like. Having upper-level education of some sort, even if you just get a 2 year degree, is an asset to your future employers. It'll help you to make more money, to discover new things that you enjoy, and to generally just learn new things. It's really a win-win, even if you have to work hard to put yourself through and support yourself you'll come out a more well-rounded person and you'll be more prepared for whatever the working world brings you.", "Would you say the 30G Cleo Neve fits  more like a 28GG or 28G?

But the thing is that he knows this about me, and doesn't find it too be too big of a problem, so it's never been a big deal. However, it is a big deal for you. Like the other posters have said, try to focus the conversation around her impulsiveness and what problems you have with it. I think it's important that you are just plain honest with your feelings, and she needs to know that you aren't going to pretend that you are 100% on board with everything she does, especially when she doesn't consult you beforehand.If she finds this part of her to be a major part of her personalty that she isn't willing to compromise, maybe it's time you examine if you are willing to deal with these decisions that she makes. e: Also I think other posters have made a great point that there may be a problem that comes out in the form of impulsive behaviors. The fact that she uses you as like a safety net and isn't very secure about these decisions makes me think that she might be an insecure person herself.", "My personal rule is that if you are shorter than 5'6'' then you better have an amazing personality.

Yes, it is frustrating how it happens, but a big part of this is due to the radicalization of a movement, and in those cases, smaller details would be shut out in favor of strong moving change. A lot of details and nuances of some civil rights movements are lost int he process, and even within movements, there are a lot of criticism about how to protest. (Lots of people agree that there is racism, but there are a lot of differing opinions on how to deal with it)A big part of examining this is understanding who has the power in the forces that are in play here. Lets say you are in high school and you are just being observant between the interactions between the popular kids, and the unpopular ones. If a group of popular kids calls a bunch of unpopular kids losers, and antagonizes them, the unpopular kids mostly just deal with it, when it happens in the other way around, the popular kids are able to brush it off a lot more easily because well...they have more power/influence over the unpopular kids. Yeah it's mean when the unpopular kids antagonize the popular kids, but it usually is done out of response to the initial bully (fighting fire with fire), and/or it's simply ineffective. If you take that and apply it to any movement from a minority culture to a mainstream culture, you can see something similar happen. The criticisms of the minority culture hurt so much more than the other way around simply because the mainstream culture has so much more power and influence. *edited for grammar", "My best friend who is also Vietnamese had that kind of issue with his family (she was not thin, and not Asian), and basically he ended up having to cut his family out of his life.

He moved away and now he is happily married with his now wife. I'm Chinese and had a similar fight with my mom over my boyfriend at the time (which was skinny, short, and Colombian) and my mom and I had a huge falling out. He ended up being a terrible boyfriend and I broke up with him, and my relationship with my mom just went back to normal. I'm kinda of sad that I didn't get to \"prove my mom wrong\" but I always saw it as that he was not good enough to end my relationship over my mom for.

It took a few weeks to kick in, but once it did I felt much better and everything was fine (good, even!) for four years. What I think happened is my body chemistry changed or something and the Prozac just stopped working for me. I emotionally sank from February-ish until September when I finally went to see my doctor (after scheduling and cancelling four other attempts to see her due to, well, the very thing I needed to see her about) and she put me on Wellbutrin. It took about three weeks to reach full efficacy.But the Wellbutrin didn't fix me, it just made things a little easier. When I was on Prozac I felt normal (whatever that means) but the Wellbutrin has only lessened the symptoms, not eliminated them. I still struggle. Not every day. Sometimes not for weeks. But now I don't feel crushed under the weight of my own brain. There are times, after something particularly emotional or uncomfortable, when I sob uncontrollably in my car, thoughts like \"I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this,\" running through my head, but the next morning I feel better. I feel happiness again. I can touch the highs, but I still feel the lows in a big way. The best thing Wellbutrin has given me (or rather, has taken away from me) is that I no longer think constantly about dying. I used to walk around work, smile on my face, chatting with my colleagues, and wonder at the thought that no one has realized that I'm crumbling inside and want to die. Since I've started down my most recent path to recovery I've started to tell people what I am/was going through. I want people to understand. I want people to bear witness to my pain. It sounds weird, maybe, but I need that validation. And at the end of this giant post, I want to say that there is hope. There is hope and comfort in places you haven't realized exist yet.

Tell her that her life is important. Tell her you love her and care about her. That you're there for her. Take her for a walk. Even if she doesn't want to talk about her mental health, just walking with another person is helpful. You alone cannot heal her, but your support can mean the difference between life and death. If you feel comfortable enough you can ask her if she might think it's a good idea to see a doctor. She might fight you on this. Actively be there for her. Don't wait for her to come to you.

Trying my best not to man-splain, but I'm also currently working on doing something with my male privilege.One of your privileges as a man is that your male friends and just other random dudes will listen to you more than they will listen to a female. So use that to call your guy friends out when they're being sexist. And being sexist includes a lot of things that are subtle but still contribute to sexism. Examples include:- At a bar, going up to a girl you don't know and putting your arm around her or touching her without talking to her first. This may or may not seem benign to you, but girls have to be on high alert when they go to a bar. You may think you're being smooth, but she thinks, \"What if this guy tries to kiss me / do something sexual and I don't want to and my friends aren't with me to stop him?\" Because in a bar there ARE guys who want to take advantage of women.- Calling a girl a bitch, prude, any derogatory term because she wouldn't sleep with you, kiss you, OR GIVE YOU ANY ATTENTION AT ALL. This is important. Girls don't owe you attention just because you show them you're interested, and they definitely don't owe you sex.- Any sexist jokes like \"Get back in the kitchen\" or \"make me a sandwich\" or \"typical woman driver\", etc. Even if you say these ironically, there will be guys in your friend group that laugh at it and believe it. It's better to stop the joke when someone tells it to show your friends that these stereotypes are untrue and offensive. Would you make this joke in front of a woman? If not, then it probably has some sexist undertones.This became a much longer post than I planned.

But I don't hold grudges or claim melancholicly that I hate everyone and want them to die. My emotions are more transient, I think of them as the surface ripples on an ocean. The waters underneath are still and calm even if the surface looks angry. This and the lack of interest in other people means that I don't bother hating. It is simpler to solve the current problem and prevent them from wanting to annoy me again.Also I am not perceived as cold by people I consider good company, I actually make a conscious effort to be a loyal and useful friend, if a bit blunt and emotionally unavailable. I have a good understanding of how people think, feel. and react even if I don't feel the same emotional response so I can easily engage in conversation on emotive topics and give the acceptable response despite not giving a damn, I am not autistic. I tend to be more honest about my lack of interest in emotional topics around friends who know the real me and don't care particularly that I am the way I am. Theory of mind is distinct from empathic response. So whilst I don't speak for all sociopaths I know I am not hateful, more an indifferent problem solver. I don't arbitrarily want you to suffer but I also don't really give a damn if you do. I personally think those that express hate for the people around them are generally not sociopaths. I do feel contempt for many people but I don't hate them. They are inferior not some sort of adversary. They aren't worth the thought.So there is probably nothing to stop me being \"cold\" but if I liked you then you probably wouldn't even realise I was, that's the truth of it.", "I see your point but I would argue there is no objective difference. I don't mean hallucinogenics hold any real meaning in and of themselves, I agree that they do not. But that said there is compelling evidence of the use of [ayahuasca in the treatment of addicts]( and they tend to claim that the DMT caused them to address the underlying problems mentally that were causing them to be stuck in their addiction. Also the use of [mdma based psychotherapy for PTSD]( [ketamine in the treatment of depression]( [psilocybin for anxiety]( don't believe psychadellic have answers in and of themselves but there is compelling evidence that they can help certain people in certain situations, in the right dose.After all, what is the difference between a manufactured thought and a real one? If a person feels better and quits heroin or responds better to PTSD therapy through MDMA use, was it really just having their brain tricked? I would argue that those count as genuine experiences with profound results and can very much include substantial realisations.", "Pretty much this. Treat me like a dick and your life will definitely become more awkward whenever I can make it so, usually without them realizing I am fucking them over. But for people who have little impact or don't annoy me I generally leave them to it unless I fancy some sport, this can be either negative or positive but generally alleviates boredom for a while.Occasionally I help certain people, I try to ensure that they don't realize I'm involved. I do sometimes enjoy spotting their weaknesses and subtly driving them towards fixing them. Everyone has hobbies.Nobody has a particularly profound impact upon me, apart from possibly my girlfriend.

I have gotten a lot better at consciously being aware of my poor impulse control plus I have developed strategies with a therapist to recognise and help me deal with situations where I would previously have been unable to regulate myself and I also tend to try and avoid situations where I wouldn't be able to behave in the way I have decided to behave. I have certainly been loyal to my current girlfriend and I do have some loyalty to certain people I know. These people tend to know what I am and that I can be quite unpredictable but enjoy being around me and I intentionally don't deliberately fuck them over in any meaningful way so I guess I am a loyal friend to them. Loyalty is situational, cross me and I will show you none but if you don't then I am not actively malicious.The previous partners I got bored with I dumped, I didn't see any point in prolonging boredom. I tend to use people for one thing or another regardless of respect and loyalty. If people don't serve a purpose and are passive then I ignore them, I think of them as background. If people don't serve a purpose and annoy me or try to fuck with me then I fuck them over one way or another.I respect intelligence, it makes for better conversation then ignorance or stupidity. Intelligent people tend to be useful allies. I respect those I consider my equal or intellectually superior (although I am yet to meet many of these). Perhaps it isn't quite how you think of respect. I wouldn't say I admire them or feel any deference towards them but I consider them better than others.

An example of this is that I am colourblind, my perception of colour is probably vastly different from yours yet we can still discuss a beautiful sunset. I cannot explain the colours I see to you any more than you can to me. I can only describe my own perception. They are entirely subjective and a part of a hallucination in our own private worlds. I can experience emotions within a trip that would be difficult to describe but could be attributed to my brain working to resolve past issues, I probably couldn't describe those emotional states but they may have helped me gain introspection in that moment, they may have really altered the structure of my brain and I would literally think differently because of that.My argument wasn't that you were saying drugs don't work. You were incorrect to suggest that just because hallucinatory experiences were subjective and not shared with others they could bring no introspection or \"substantial realization\" the source of those thoughts is immaterial and actually the ~~DMT/Ayahuasca study~~ directly contradicts what you were saying.EDIT: Grammar and rereading the parent comments to actually work out what I was replying to in the first place... hence this got rewritten a bit.EDIT2: Not the Ayahuasca study, the MDMA one!

Your entire perception of the world around you is a subjective hallucination which worked extremely well to allow your ancestors to survive and propagate your genetic line.

The way in which our society raises boys vs girls strengthens these small biological differences, making them into something much more than they are.  (And don't tell me boys and girls aren't raised differently, because even the most radical parent would struggle to push against what has been ingrained into our brains by the society that has been built around us.)  Sexual behavior in women, is not different because of biology.  A good example of something similar I can think of: ADHD's presentation in boys vs girls.  Boys tend to present with ADHD at a much younger age than girls do, and it presents as rough-housing and setting fires.  Whereas girls seem to present at a later age, and their ADHD presents as depression instead.  Why is this?  Because from a young age, it is normalized for boys to act a certain way, and so a young boy acting out is treated differently than a young girl acting out.  The young girl with ADHD is treated as if she is being unladylike/rude, whereas the boy is just 'being a boy'.  The fact that ADHD presents as depression in girls, is because they were not allowed to act out the way their male counterparts were.  I believe that it is probably a similar thing with sexual behavior.  Girls are not allowed to be as sexually interested as boys are, from a young age.  We're told it is more normal for boys, so why would girls feel okay being what they think is wrong?As someone who was born with a vagina, uterus, breasts and natural production of estrogen, but is male, I don't believe that my lack of testosterone makes me less sexual.  My presentation of male DOES make me feel more comfortable being openly sexual.  And in having mostly female friends, I would say that they like/want sex just as much (if not more) than the male friends I have, but when they talk about it they are told they're gross or sluts, but boys aren't criticized as much. Even in school, my biology teacher says to the class that boys think about sex more than girls do, and I couldn't imagine this being true.  Sure, boys are sexually driven, but the only reason females aren't, is because they aren't allowed to be.  This being said, what is it that we are even talking about as \"biology\", are we talking about genitals or hormones?  Because I believe that it is hormones that cause people to have sexual drive, not their genitals, and in this case, certain foods and activities increase testosterone/estrogen.  I have two female friends, both born female, who exercise/work out so much that their testosterone levels became much higher than natural.  In fact, they needed to take estrogen supplements in order to continue growing breasts/having periods.  I also know of a boy in my grade who was born male, but has extremely high levels of estrogen, making it hard for him to grow hair, and even making him deal with ailments usually only females have.  Men who are born without dicks and testosterone, usually end up taking testosterone shots at some point in their life.  A side-effect listed is: heightened-sex drive.  So if it is testosterone that causes this higher sex drive, I don't believe it is a sex difference, its a hormone difference. Is my female friend (born with a vagina) any less female because she has more testosterone in her system than estrogen?  No.  And this is not a radical/transgender opinion, this is speaking to her genitals and the impact they have on her sex drive.  It is not her sex that makes her sex drive the way it is, its hormones.  And even so, the difference is not as large as society pushes it to be.  Women want sex just as much as men do, but they've been forced to keep this hidden/not talk openly about it, so of course they have (over time) become more inward about their sexual desires than men (who are allowed to openly be sexual, because that's just the \"way they are\")In my honest opinion, I don't understand why in a society where some males have high estrogen levels, and some females have high testosterone levels we would have such set sex descriptors/characteristics.  In the same question of: why does it matter who we are attracted to?  At the base of biology: friction is friction, sex is sex, and the fact that we are \"straight\" or \"gay\" or anything is only because we feel weird going out of societal norms.  I do not believe anyone is born gay, or straight, or anything like that, because everyone has preferences they figure out in their life.  If a straight guy would fuck a woman in the ass, why would he not be okay fucking a woman with a dick in the ass?  Are we really attracted to genitals?  Would a hot guy with a vagina make a girl a \"lesbian\"?  If you had brown rabbits and white rabbits, and you made an observation that all white rabbits ate green leaves and all brown rabbits ate orange leaves, would you just refer to the exceptions as exceptions?  Or would you change your rule? In the end of it all, I believe that not only gender is a construct we police way too much (giving the people in our society that don't match our rules) but sexuality is also a construct.", "I argue everything people say.  I like to look at the positive always, so when people complain, I seem to argue them and point out what is good or why what they're complaining about happened.", "I am an  rather than an , but I am so close between T/F that I consider myself to be able to relate to either types.  Reading this post makes me...emotional almost, because I understand it so much; I relate to every single point.  (I'm unsure if this is because I'm ENxP or because these are things that people just...do).  I am mentally ill, and some of these things seem to be connected to my mental illness, so there may be that as well. 1. Taking care of everyone else.I can never, I mean NEVER get my homework done.  But when anyone asks me for help with their homework, I am so on it.  I am successful in helping others get their work done well.  I am unsure why I do this, when it would be just as easy for me to do my own homework, but for some reason, helping others seems like a better use of my time (even though I know that I really NEED to do my homework). I do this with emotions less so, because I've gotten to the point of overthinking all emotional reactions and get overwhelmed when thinking about it.  2. Disappearing from their lives for long periods of time.I often have this feeling...a need to disconnect from people I have upset or people I've become too dependent on.  I self-sabotage relationships often, so sometimes leaving sounds like a good option.  Of course, I struggle with leaving people for a long time very much, I need to have social interaction with people I love in order to feel happy; and it's hard for me to stay close with people I don't talk to everyday.  3. Constantly. Staying. Busy.I don't do my homework anymore, but I am never not doing anything.  I need to be on reddit, or writing, or analyzing something so that I am not doing nothing.  I need to be writing something at least, because my brain is constantly narrating things.   4. Continuously claiming that youâ€™re fine.I do this, to others and myself.  Even though I want people to know I need help, and I want them to know I'm struggling (for attention), I pretend that at the base of everything, I'm okay.5. Developing irrational anxieties.â€™I don't have anxiety about things often anymore (I have been medicated for a few years now), but when I do, it's about something completely irrational.  I do not get stressed about getting my homework done, which is bad, because this means I lack the motivation I need.  I do get stressed, but about things that make no sense what so ever.  6. Putting a positive spin on everything.THIS.  THIS.  This is what I do that annoys all my friends so very much.  I am a debater, I am the devil's advocate, and so when people complain to me about ANYTHING, I look at it from the perspective of the person who hurt them, saying that it was probably not anything personal and the person has their own issues.  I seem to always take the positive side, even when talking about something inherently negative. 7. Wanting to plan everything ahead of time.I always create notebooks, plans, schedules, journals, etc. in order to get my homework done.  I feel like I NEED to get organized and create written plans before I start any homework.  This proves to be a waste of time that I could be using to do my homework, but I struggle to feel able to start until I create a plan.  I am not an organized person, I don't follow schedules, but I need to write things out before I can even think about doing them. 8. Dating people who are wrong for you.Okay.  I literally will date anyone who is interested in me, even though I am not very interested in being in a relationship at all.  I've dated so many people, knowing that the relationship would end, but not really caring.  This is really bad for the people I date, it's mean and unfair but I do it all the time.  I never want to say no to people, and there's no point in saying no really.  The relationship will end eventually. 9. Turning EVERYTHING into a joke.I joke about everything.  No joke. 10. Presenting a tough-as-nails exterior.I have this need to be manly and not emotional, this is connected number 9.  I joke about things to make it seem like I am tough and fine.  Even when I am trying to get help/attention in saying how bad I am doing, I want to seem tough and manly.

They both release endorphins and neurotransmitters that can, depending on the person and the way the use them, lead to incredible pleasure, motivation and productivity, or to addiction, withdrawal and harm. Breakups can lead to feeling the same way you feel when withdrawing from heroin and cocaine at the same time, as your dopamine, serotonin AND endorphins are exhausted at the same fucking time. Sex gives you a rush of serotonin, dopamine and endorphins, and serves as a workout. The takeaway from this is you should have regular sex as a safe substitute for painkillers, anxiolytics and stimulants, while avoiding relationships to prevent withdrawal.Personally, though, I prefer to maintain a secure source of drugs in order to feel great and be motivated and productive. I have the following schedule: Concerta 36-54mg/day (prescription from my psychiatrist) for energy, productivity, motivation and mood elevation, Lyrica 600-900mg/day for anxiolysis and relaxation (OTC in my country), Alpha GPC 400mg/day for concentration, Aniracetam for helping short term and long term memory, as well as concentration and imagination, Galantamine 8mg/day for enhancing the action of Alpha GPC, Sulbutiamine 600mg/day to help memory, melatonin 3mg/day for sleep quality, plus xanax 1mg/day for 2 weeks every other month (prescription from my psychoanalyst(yes, I have both a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. I love going to doctors)), weed on the weekends and sometimes before sleep on other days, MDMA once per month, Cocaine twice a year, Caffeine 0-8 espressos or monsters per day, Codeine 80-160mg once every month or two, Alcohol 40% 350-600ml every other weekend, plus whatever other drug I may try in the future. The drugs maintain me at a superhuman level. I have been tested by my psychiatrist before Concerta and have an IQ of 149, and with Concerta my productivity has tripled. I study to enter a university (mathematics) 5-8 hours/day, workout 1-1/5 hours/day, study programming (my career choice) 3-6 hours/day, practice on the piano 1-2 hours/day, hang out with my friends 2-12 hours/day, and hang out alone on my computer for 6-18 hours per day. I manage to do this by having constant all nighters, which is very easy when you have Concerta and are supported by your parents without needing to work yet, but are still out of school (18 years old), therefore having a free schedule. Sex increases my productivity and motivation even more, but it is certainly not needed when you are on all this shit.

I get 10mg codeine+50mg caffeine+400mg paracetamol/acetaminophen pills, to which I perform a cold water extraction to remove the paracetamol/acetaminophen. Which means for 80mg codeine I get 400mg caffeine which is 3 coffees, and for 160mg codeine I get 800mg caffeine which is 6 coffees. With xanax I drink one monster per 1mg, which is 160mg caffeine/1mg xanax. I can definitely handle much more than that with my incredible caffeine tolerence plus the downers. 10mg codeine is equivalent to 1mg morphine, by the way.

So when I claim that the school is xanax free, it is xanax free.The real reason I fucked him over is that 3 months before that he had screwed me over in a xanax deal. I made the mistake of fronting the money (20 euros, nothing special, but it's the act that matters), since we had made a lot of deals, and he constantly delayed bringing me the xanax, which he never did. You don't screw me over and get away with it, I'll fuck you over later a hundred times more as a matter of principle.

People would be more drawn to me, I wouldnt necessarily want to talk to people all the time because it can get exhausting, but  I did find that I attracted people more in that sense. (That they wanted to talk to me and etc)Very independent is a great trait to describe myself, generally I'm always only with one of my best friends or close friends. Confidence ? Well I am but only when it comes to talking and my writing, generally I like to simplify whatever im saying to make it easier for everybody to understand where I'm getting at.So being coherent is very important. My humours more along the lines of being dry/sarcastic. I like people, but when someone goes out of their way to be blatantly ignorant or rude, I dont see the sense of hanging out with someone like that all the time.But because I'm a eneagram 1 this could be the reason I'm more reserved quiet, then most Extroverts I don't know.

Growing up getting my hair done was the scariest thing in the world. Nmum once told me a story about how i was such a cry baby when I was 5 and when it came to my hair, apparently I had been crying about my hair to the point where the neighbours had come around and told her that she needed to quiet me down because it could get to a point where they would call the cops about it. Nmum would always pull,comb harshly,relax monthly,sometimes even weekly every time I'd go to the hairsalon I'd either get a relaxer or a perm of some kind of a trim which meant cutting 5 inches of my head. Growing up I had knee length long hair and I remember how it was always a staple of my identity having long,thick curly hair. Everyone complimented me on it. By 15 my hair was thin, breaking and barely got past my jawline. That's how short it got because of the mistreatment over the years. Nmums hair was always shorter than mine or tougher in texture than mine was (that's because she always cut it so to say Nmum was jealous is an understatement. That is apart from the disgusted comments and shit I got every time I washed my hair during those times, even now from random family members. What's funny about it is I'm 21 and yet most of aunts and stuff always gesture to my mother when asking about what I'm gonna do with my hair, I've gone 10+ months without relaxing and my hairs never been better.

But that is neither the caseFi generally to me at least is a lot like individualism.So initially it is not possible to paint a whole sub group of a personality as having narcissistic tendencies or not. In conclusion that article is very faulty and generally is trying to paint the whole dynamic of Introvert = Covert Narcissist Extrovert = Overt NarcissistWhen none of that is true. A sure way for me at least to differentiate between someone who has narcissistic tendencies and not is the intention behind the motive, and also the lack of empathy.Also they have tendency to not own up to their problems and or mistakes.

Explaining to him what your idea of a relationship should be like, how you consider him close, and how this could be seen as form of betrayal/if you dont want to be harsh and blunt explain to him how this secrecy goes against what your moral ethics are when it comes to relationships etc).But I would really suggest is you take time out alone and really think of your deal breakers/moral ethics, when it comes to relationships and what they are.And once you've come to a conclusion on that all the better.

Relationships are about coming to a compromise no matter what the situation.If he is still dismissive about this after you have continuously expressed your frustration in not knowing/and does not want to come to some sort of compromise. I would honestly consider this a deal breaker if not a peak into his perspective of how he views the relationship. Again actions speak louder then words.

If someone were to be cruelly exploited publicly, I would recognise this as a cruel act.Where as someone who does not have empathy (again not someone who is not choosing to have empathy but does not have it as a default)Would look at this very similar situation and see it as a default. A thing that happens there's nothing really wrong with it.Again as I said before, you can choose not to show emotion (The choice of not empathizising) but again this is not true because you would still have the ability to see something as cruel or not etc. Which is empathy.So this one is a bit tricky.Because the underlying factor in a lot of Narcissists and how they became varies quite a lot.Some narcississts inherit it from their parents/family members others have had wonderful childhoods but still do come out as being narcissistic.I'm still trying to figure this one out myself, since it seems to be family inherited thing for myself.If you do want to know more about narcissists and their underlying character istics I have found this [website] ( be quite informative and helpfull.", "Unfortunately I dont live in the US.But thank you for the suggestion.I am going to be more aware of my uncle from now on, and perhaps I'll try to go out on weekends more just to try and avoid them all.", "Honestly I believe you can take a lot from peoples reactions to things.Ask her about it or make a common light hearted joke about how you came about this folder and how weird it was.If her reaction is weird or she is quite embarrassed about it with you finding out, but doesn't entirely explain why she has the folder, then you can be a little worried.But generally if she is quite open to discussion and actually tells u why the folder is there, then there is nothing merely to worry about.

We always had to keep our lips sealed tight on anything until Nmum decided to ask/or decided it would be ugly or not right if the other children were eating in front of us and we had nothing.

What's strange about it is, she would always go out of here way to spoil her friends children by buying them things out of the blue or perhaps out of the price range that she would usually spend on us.

Her channel takes on the form of the more typical teenage girl “popularity” (SF) fashion tips channels but she’s taking that and subverting it. For that reason, I’m seeing the values (F) of the tribe (Fe) as her demon. Instead, she is doing these videos for her own reasons (Ti) but trying to speak the tribe’s language of popularity and glam and looks. It’s also clear (to me at least) that she has put a lot of forethought and reflection in to what she is doing. Contrast that with Jennifer Aniston who was Fi. She didn’t have a lot of reasons or thoughts behind what was driving her, it just felt good and she like it so she went with it. Kristen seems to be thinking deeper than that.

First, I’ll just say that the animation was absolutely beautiful. The show looks amazing in every way. I also want to say that I really did try my best to give the show a chance. I watched the entire series, even though I already knew after the first season that it wasn’t my cup of tea. I do think it does suffer from following ATLA. I will say that ATLA is my favorite television series (for context, I’m a woman in my 30s who has seen a fair amount of TV in my day including current prestige television so this is high praise). It’s not critically the *best* show that I’ve ever seen but it brings me the most joy to sit down and watch out of all the TV shows I’ve seen. So, TLOK had huge shoes to fill from the get-go and actually I’ve had lots of debates with my husband on this point. He basically tapped out after the first season whereas I kept reminding him that there was no way TLOK was going to match ATLA. Very few shows match ATLA in my book. So, I’m going to try to avoid comparisons to ATLA in this reply because I don’t think it’s entirely fair to hold up TLOK against ATLA. Okay so what I didn’t like about TLOK. First, right off the bat... I wasn’t a big fan of Korra herself. I understand that she’s a teenager finding her way but I found it hard to relate to her as a hero for our story. I think they were trying to show an Avatar who had all the bending skill down but needed to grow spiritually but that story didn’t land for me. Maybe I’m getting old but I just found her frustrating more than likable. I guess that was another issue I had with the show. I personally didn’t find myself really liking or relating to any of the characters. I “sort of” liked Tenzin but then they made him even a little annoying and bratty, especially with his siblings. Also, his kids were mostly annoying to me... all except Jinora who I did generally like.I also didn’t care for the setting. I didn’t like seeing cars and airships etc in my Avatar world. It just seemed like a huge jump and it felt awkward. That being said, they executed the setting very well, everything looked great, I just didn’t want to be in that world anyway. Let’s talk about the bending... this was another issue that my husband and I had with TLOK. We are both martial artists and absolutely loved and respected how the martial arts were shown in ATLA. To me - and yes it started with probending but I feel like it ran through the whole series - the attention to detail and love of the martial arts just wasn’t there.Then there are some overall story beats that I just wish hadn’t happened and ultimately these are the real problems I had. I did not like the “origin” of the Avatar spirit as shown in Korra (I.e. Raava etc). It just felt off to me, like a retcon that didn’t fit the lore as we were shown in ATLA. The story of the four nations on the lion turtles was all fine and all but just felt strange and didn’t seem to match the idea we had from ATLA that humans learned bending from the animals / spirits of the world. I also had big issues with bringing back the airbenders. I mean, I know we can’t expect Tenzin to repopulate the nation on his own (I was already annoyed with his family dynamic anyway but I won’t go there) but the story of airbending returning and then them going around recruiting airbenders just didn’t land for me.So those are some of my thoughts. There is probably more I could pick out but those are the big ones that come to mind. Admittedly, it’s probably been a couple of years since I last watched TLOK so it may be time for a rewatch. I wanted to like the series, but it just didn’t land for me and I had trouble staying invested in it. I’ve reached the point in my life where if something isn’t my jam I just pass on it and move on. That’s where TLOK ended up for me.

I love to learn new things and new methods for doing things. I am inspired when people do things in a new and different way. I look for challenge and growth when looking for new interests and activities. I am physically active and prefer activities that allow me to be constantly learning and performing new exercises. I practiced martial arts for many years and always enjoyed learning and mastering new forms and techniques. I have found my path in life by looking at the options and choosing something that I am interested in and that will help me grow as a person. I am particularly intrigued by learning new things or new ways of approaching old problems. While I may not always be able to come up with a ingenious solution myself, I enjoy learning about one when someone else has found it and shared it. I am troubled by ideas that are illogical or non-sensical. For example, it bothers me to see national leaders taking stances that are clearly in contrast with established science. I would say that my interests are slowly evolving. I do tend to stick with one interest for a period of time (right now it’s MBTI), once I’ve learned a lot about a topic and feel that I’ve been able to integrate what I’ve learned into my life I’ll move on to a new interest. To me, “understanding” is the ability to grasp a concept and, if needed, explain it to others or apply it in ones life. It is very important to me. In my mind, if you are going to become interested in something, you should strive to understand it as fully as you can. Logic plays a strong role in my thoughts. I typically remain rational and logical in my thoughts and actions and seeing people act illogically actually bothers me.7 I am afraid of failure and not being accepted. I am typically a very vocal person but if I’m not sure if what I’m saying is correct or if I don’t think I’ll be accepted, I will become shy. It’s actually a funny thing. I’m almost always a take-charge kind of person but if I think that I somehow won’t succeed or if I think someone will judge me poorly for whatever reason, I will shy away from taking the reins. I’ve learned to push through this in the work place and will take on something even before I know I will succeed but it’s something I know I need to push myself into. Adversity typically hits me very hard initially but once I’m able to dust myself off, I almost always rise to the challenge and come back even better than before. While I’ve never been diagnosed with mental illness, I do go through periods of depression especially when I’m not sure if I’m really making the impact I want to or when I’m feeling like I’m not as successful as I want to be. Negative emotions can hit me and stay around for days at a time. Typically, I will stay in a funk until I’m able to figure out a way to solve the issue and overcome the adversity. This can be very hard, such as when I lost two immediate family members within 18 months of each other. I had to figure out how I would approach life in a new way in order to overcome that adversity. I’m never self-destructive physically, I have strong mental discipline and - even at my worst - I will not make choices that are unhealthy for myself or my family. I do become mentally self-destructive, though and will hit myself with negative thinking about not being “good enough.”8 I had a very stable and supportive upbringing. Probably the most “outlying” circumstance in my childhood was the fact that I was the youngest child by 7 years and the only girl (with two older brothers). I think this made me more independent and more of a “tomboy.” My older brothers tended to get into more trouble than I did and as a result, I did not always get as much attention as they did.  That being said, growing up my older brother’s would tease me by saying that our parents were easy on me and that I was spoiled. This did make me question myself as a child. I think this affected my adulthood in a few ways. As a result of my upbringing, I am an assertive woman, very much at home in the male dominated field of engineering. I have no problems standing up for myself, even in a leadership position. Secondly, my questioning myself, I think, made me overly competitive. If I didn’t believe the praise I was getting from my parents, then I would try to win at anything I could so that I could measure myself against others in an objective way. When I think back on my childhood, it generally does feel good and safe if a bit lonely at times. I remember a lot about my childhood and often think back to those times with fondness because I was much more hopeful about the future than I am now. I’ve become more cynical and jaded. I actually enjoyed being a kid and wasn’t one who wanted to “grown up.” I was a hopeful and curious child; I’m still curious but certainly less hopeful.9 My dreams tend to be very realistic, to the point where I have had dreams where I begin to realize that I’m in a dream but everything feels so real that I’m genuinely unsure. I probably remember one or two dreams per week, depending on my sleep quality. When I was younger, I would have a recurring dream of a car careening off a highway overpass or bridge, it used to scare me awake! I haven’t had that dream in a while now and I really don’t think I have recurring dreams anymore. My dreams generally don’t have a recurring pattern but one thing that does come up more often is a sense of trying to hide or get away and not being able to do. Sometimes its a relatively mundane thing like trying to find a bathroom and only finding a toilet out in public that I have to use and sometimes it’s more frightening like trying to get away from some sort of attacker and being unable to hide. Along those same lines, I have this recurring thing where I’ll hit some one and do absolutely no harm whatsoever. Like the strike is entirely ineffectual. Yes, I have lucid dreamt because I really was trying to at the time. I had signed up for an email course on how to lucid dream and was actively trying to do it. I’ve been able to make myself fly a few times but that’s about it. Now that I’m not actively trying to lucid dream, I don’t.10 The archetype that feels the most relatable to me would be the coming of age hero. I’m 35 years old and absolutely LOVE Moana. That story of a young girl, finding her own way to be a leader of her people speaks to me on so many levels.

She said that one of the ways she had to deal with it was to literally write down “I feel angry” or “I feel sad” when the feelings came up so that she could even acknowledge them. For my part, I think that Fi is not my “worst” demon because at this point I think I’m an IxxJ with savior control and demon “gather,” so I am able to somewhat balance my feelings with the tribe’s reasons but I always go to the tribe to tell me if what I’m feeling is “acceptable.” Not everyone does this; for example, my husband doesn’t do this at all.

This perception of s is one of the reasons I’ve struggled with it as my type despite multiple tests always coming up the same for me. I work for a large engineering corporation and I don’t consider myself a workaholic. I never take my computer or work phone with me on vacations and always have tried to maintain my personal life boundaries and keep work / personal life balanced and separate despite the strong corporate pressure to do otherwise. I think a big reason for this, though, is my own personal experience. My older brother was a classic workaholic - he would regularly bring his work along on family holidays and other breaks. I saw how stressed he was and never wanted to emulate that. At 37 years old he had a fatal stroke and that loss obviously affected me greatly. He was 7 years older than me so I was still relatively early in my career and not yet in management when he died. Now that I am a manager, the pressure to work 24/7 is even higher and still I resist it. All that being said, I do think  seems to be my best fit type and your characterization wasn’t really that far off. I may not spend my time always working for the company that pays me but when I’m not at work I use those same industrious tendencies to get stuff done around the house, to take care of the kids and other responsibilities. Thanks for the post, I’ll go back and read my husband’s type now ;)", "To me, their new model is an interesting contrast to how OP splits of up the four \"temperaments.\" Both PH and OP are essentially breaking up the categories based on the lead function but they are coming to slightly different conclusions based on how these functions operate. Perhaps the biggest difference is with the IPs so I'd like to go ahead and unpack that one.Under the FIRM model, IPs are fixated on \"Rightness\" because of their over-reliance on their introverted decider function. Because the Di function prioritizes and seeks subjective understanding, the IP will tend to fixate on this idea of needing to be \"right.\" Being right gets ingrained into their ego-identity because it takes time for them to gain that subjective understanding.By contrast, OP assigns the IPs to the human need of \"significance\" or \"individualization\" which never quite made sense to me from a function standpoint. Having an introverted decider function does not necessarily mean that one is *always* self above tribe. Actually, if a person Fi-values family and they are lead Fi they may in practice do a *lot* for the family and may look an awful lot like an EJ, killing themselves for tribe but in fact they are doing it based on their own personal value system. My observation has been that what will show someone as Lead Di vs Lead De is whether or not they seek out external validation / direction (De) or if they simply do for the tribe without asking for or needing the validation (Di). The Lead Di may do quite a bit for the tribe but they won't naturally go to the tribe to ask what the tribe actually wants.Edited: spelling", "When she jumps on his belly at the end! ��“Pan loves you anyway!!”", "I think the super friends team for me would be Augustus, Ned and (I guess) Aubrey with Griffin as the GM and I’d take any of the three worlds really.

First, I think you should figure out what his MBTI is, whether by outright asking him or piecing it together in your head based on what you know about him.Anyway, I was also in the same boat where I didn't feel like my needs were met. He preached about direct communication, but whenever I wanted to tell him my fears, worries, and doubts, he would shut me down. It felt completely unfair because he was such a proponent of direct communication. He was very dismissive of my thoughts. He also didn't seem to be as emotionally invested into our relationship as I was. He didn't care about giving me advance notice when he was going out of town after he came back from a 2 month long business trip. He didn't even care about proper goodbyes after I hadn't seen him for so long. I felt emotionally neglected and belittled. I broke up with him even though he apologized and tried to take me out on a date. I stood my ground and I spoke to him in his language (trying to mirror his phrases since  do not compute feelings well). \"I do not feel fulfilled in our relationship and you are not aligned with my expectations in our relationship.\" I proceeded to tell him some of the reasons why. He accepted what I had to say and we parted ways. He's never one to burn bridges so he was worried about whether we would remain friends. I have issues with that, but I said I would try my best because I do not hate him. Fast forward a month and a half later, he texts me to congratulate me on moving out of my parents' house. We had texted before that but it was awkward for me and never an actual conversation. He congratulated me and then said he'd cut it short because he knew that I still felt awkward. I thought to myself, I think I'm okay now talking to him. I used that opportunity to gain closure from our 4-month relationship. During that conversation, he opened himself up to me. He apologized and realized what he had done wrong. He said that he should have shown how much he really cared about me. So, this is very much like what you went through. We talked for about 6 hours that night and I barely got any sleep before work (no regrets hehe). After that, I thought deeply about our future. Like you, I missed him like crazy. Could it work if we tried again? I think because you guys have talked, that is a step toward allowing yourself to be vulnerable around him. If he can assure you that he will listen when you open yourself up and share your feelings, that's a step and a good sign. Going back to the love languages test, I suggest taking that so that you both understand how you prefer to give and receive love. I scored highly on \"acts of service\" and my boyfriend was afraid of that because he scores low. He feared that it is how I want to receive love, but in fact, it's how I give love. Since he doesn't feel pressured to do that to show his love for me, he is free to show his love for me in the ways that he prefers which is with quality time. I think it is easier to be vulnerable with your partner if you help them understand your MBTI and your love languages. As an , I hate conflict so I need to feel safe with my partner when bringing up problems and issues. By safe, I mean no judgment, no cutting me off, no belittling me. If I can feel safe around him, I can tell him anything without holding back.Hope this helps and good luck &lt;3", "For this, I would take the love languages quiz (I'm on my phone but it's an easy google search). I found this to be very helpful with my significant other who is an . As much as I love using MBTI as a tool, I don't think love languages are consistent among MBTIs but then again, I don't have the statistical data to prove it. For example, I'm an . You'd think I would like receiving expensive gifts but I don't. I abhor it. I think both of you should give that quiz a try - you can take it as a couple and compare scores. It's a really fascinating thing to read about and you will understand each other a lot more I hope! My love languages are: giving \"acts of service\" and receiving \"words of affirmation\", \"quality time\", and \"physical touch\".His are: giving and receiving \"quality time\" and \"physical touch\". Initially he was concerned about \"acts of service\" because the quiz doesn't tell you if that's what you prefer to give or receive. He was worried that I preferred to receive it and he scores very poorly on \"acts of service\". Since it turns out I prefer to give it, he felt comfortable with it because I don't have a need to receive it to feel fulfilled in the relationship.", "Maybe this is a bit sketchy, but for me the most affordable way is to pick up a worker either in the St. John's area (gas stations) or at the entrance to Home Depot near Ben White. It could be controversial given how some people are against illegal immigrants, but as someone from a (legal)  immigrant family, I know why they're here. It's to have a better life with better opportunities for their kids. I don't mind supporting them. Anyway, you drive in, they will swarm all over your car, you say exactly what you need and your rate, and then you pick a guy to go with you. I suggest doing this with a friend rather than doing it by yourself especially if you are a female. These guys are super hardworking and nice and I haven't had a bad experience at all. You do need to either transport them back to their original location or give them money for bus fare. I paid my guy $60 to move the heavy furniture and that included bus fare since I was in a rush to get to work on time. Not bad :)", "I am Asian and live in S Austin. If I need Asian stuff and I am lazy, I go to Fiesta by UT/Hancock Center. It has a decent Asian aisle, much better than HEB has to offer. It is also cheaper than going to Central Market and Whole Foods. But honestly, making the trip to MT Supermarket is always worth it for me. I buy a lot so I don't have to keep coming back there. There is also Han Yang market if I'm in the area and too lazy to go to MT. Whenever I go there, it's usually just to buy ready-made kimbap and to buy frozen rice cakes. I don't go there often. Only if I have a major craving for kimbap!Lastly, if you wanna get really specialized, I love going to Asahi Imports on Burnet/Koenig for Japanese grocery items. I stocked my pantry with a ton of essential ingredients for making ramen from there. It is the only place in Austin to get Sun Noodles (fresh ramen noodles). It's an amazing place honestly.", "That sounds like heaven. Next to living in Japan lol", "I personally think Ramen Tatsu-Ya is the best after trying out each place. To figure out your favorite, I recommend trying out all of the options in Austin to really know!", "This!!!! Sure, I have challenges when it comes to communicating with certain people at work, but like you (), I just go about figuring out the person's type and that helps a lot. My experience is probably unique in that everyone who works at our company really likes their job and we have a strong company culture. There is a set of defined core values that we look for in job applicants and they're not going to make it through if they don't meet our core values. Many are related to communication and not being passive-aggressive. Because our company culture is so strong, I think that it helps remind people to communicate with their project partners because otherwise, you're blocking them from moving forward on their end. Anyway, I haven't had any issues with the  at our company (a product manager and a developer). Both loop me in on updates, ask thoughtful questions in order to address my team's needs, etc. I love working with those two individuals. I'm sure there are more  at the company but they're probably healthy  (they're not snobby nor do they exude an aura of superiority as far as knowledge goes). If anything, my biggest challenges can be with I's, N's, and P's (all letters I am not). I's because sometimes they think they told you something but really they told you IN THEIR HEAD lol. N's because I'm an S and I have trouble talking about big overarching themes and ideas - I feel more value when attending meetings with concrete action items and tasks to complete because my head is in the details and in the execution of a project rather than the planning. P's because they're not as super mega detail-oriented as I am so sometimes they can make a very costly mistake and my team has to break the bad news to a customer. I enjoy working with T's because they see things I don't see and provide a different perspective. They also push me to be more data-oriented and to not take things personally when I get yelled at by customers. I enjoy working with F's because some of them are way more empathetic than I am and they give me good tips to work on that with customers. Despite these challenges, I do my best to understand my teammate or coworker. This is why we give each other feedback and do peer reviews. This is why you discuss challenges you're having with a manager. We just have a lot of systems in place so that regardless of MBTI, we can successfully work together. A lot of my coworkers don't place much value on MBTI as I do but I don't treat MBTI like the end-all be-all either. It's just a tool for quickly understanding how a person operates and based on that data, I alter my approach to them in order to get what I need from them and to communicate in the most effective manner.", "Figure out what that particular  likes, what their passions/hobbies/interests are. They will brighten up and talk about that topic for quite some time. For example, I like talking about MBTI, food, fashion, Pokémon, the Sims, Harry Potter, the Civilizations games, memes, work, and personal finance. Maybe it's not a topic that is interesting to you but not completely boring, but if you sit there and make sure the  knows you're listening, they feel happy (well, I do). Of course, it would be more fun for both parties to be able to stay equally engaged and contribute to the conversation. I personally enjoy sharing stories about myself (realizations and personal growth) in hopes that the other person will open up to me and tell me their stories as well - such topics keep me very engaged. We like talking about people: me, you, family, partners, friends, acquaintances, coworkers, etc. When you open up to an , it's incredibly satisfying and the  cherishes that moment forever (it feels like a breakthrough especially with introverts).", "I agree regarding the tsukemen.

But I would just recommend trying all of the ramen restaurants to find your favorite. Mi Hoanh Thanh, Mi Thap Cam, Bun Bo Hue: Tan My restaurant. So freaking good. This is where I go for other Vietnamese soups aside from pho. Chinese hand-pulled noodles: Xian Noodle Bar hands down.

Where did you source all of your ingredients? Btw, your bowl looks great!!!", "One of the most unhealthy things about me is that I'm passive-aggressive. I hate conflict. I avoid confronting others for as long as I can. Sometimes I can manage to escape a situation without ever confronting someone. I'm passive-aggressive because it's hard for me to make a persuasive argument that gives me the greatest chance of being right. I end up letting my feelings take over which leads to me rambling or ranting. Sometimes I fantasize that if I were a T, it would make this whole conflict resolution thing a lot easier. I don't want my relationship with that person to go sour if I confront them about an issue I have with them. I am afraid they will retaliate. I am afraid of being called a hypocrite. I am afraid that they will see every single hole in my argument and crush me into tiny broken pieces. I am afraid we won't be friends anymore. I am afraid they will take it personally. I'm passive-aggressive because I'm hoping that whatever the issue is, it's a temporary behavior or something that I need to accept or see how long I can tolerate or be more patient with them. This unhealthy aspect bleeds into my interactions with coworkers, romantic relationships, family, friends, and roommates. I also really enjoy gossip, not for the sake of ruining people's lives, but like someone else said, I think I do it in order to get closer to people. I get so much validation and excitement from someone confiding in me. I don't spill other people's secrets unless it's to a significant other whom I basically tell everything or my closest best friend.", "Yes, I actually have.

The special round is when we all watch a porn parody together and the bingo squares are quotes from the movie.

Love this :) yepppp that's exactly what I hope to achieve. /blush", "One of the best pieces of advice that I have gotten is to only spend your time with people worth spending it with. This means spending it with people that make you feel good, that genuinely care about and who also genuinely care about you, and that you have a lot of fun with. Think about whether the friendship is meaningful. Don't invest in people who don't meet that criteria. I don't know where you are in life, but this was advice I got as far as how to manage friendships as an adult out of college. I was in my last semester of college at the time. Making friends in college is so easy. You have so much time you can spend with friends and your friends are in close proximity. When you graduate and you work a full-time job, you have to allocate your time wisely between family, friends, significant others, and yourself. With so little time left, it'd be a waste to spend it with someone whose company you don't enjoy and who makes you feel terrible as a person. You're in control of your own happiness and you get to decide who is in your life. That's my philosophy. /shrug", "I scored pretty evenly among all 5 love languages except \"gifts\". Good thing my  boyfriend also scores a zero on \"gifts\". I score highest on \"acts of service\" but realized that it's how I express love rather than receive because I never expect him to do things for me, so when he does, I am very pleasantly surprised and appreciative of him. Instead, the best way that he expresses love is through \"quality time\". Now, this isn't something I'm used to because I didn't really receive love that way from my parents. Due to my upbringing, receiving love through \"words of affirmation\" is what I need to feel loved probably because I always wanted my parents to praise me instead of focusing on my flaws all the time. Because he scores so highly on \"quality time\", it's made me value it more as a love language than I did before and because that's how he naturally shows love, it means a lot to me.", "Oh..............my bad lol.

Learn how to do this in a balanced way. Meaning take time to break areas of life down and notice where one affects the other. So having a workout routine and healthy diet will easily affect your critical thinking skills at work / school. Just like exercising a muscle at the gym so it becomes stronger, learning responsibility is a practice / mental exercise. You have to do it daily. So acknowledge when you do even the smallest things where you think you are being responsible. Like keeping your word when you tell a friend you will call them back at a certain time or honoring your word by taking out the garbage because it's your turn that week to do it. I can tell a lot about how responsible a person can be by even small gestures like that. It says volumes when you value integrity and keeping your word.Also, learning how to own up your mistakes (being honest with yourself) and learning from them (just don't repeat the mistake) is a sign of responsibility *and* maturity. But owning up to them doesn't necessarily mean beating yourself up for them because that's counter productive.Go hang out also at /r/UpliftingNews and /r/LifeProTips and you're already ahead of the game.Also, Lifeprotip: if you learn (practice) how to enjoy fulfilling your responsibilities, you're training your mind to be  happy as well and you will more easily do that same responsibilty the next time around with more ease and speed.

He really cares, but he's blunt and tells it how it is. It feels real and I really appreciate that. Okay sorry for that rant.", "Hmmmm. Yeah, I'd say so, but with a couple caveats and considerations. After writing this, I hope it's not too confusing. Let me know if you have any questions or if you can relate to this!I definitely read the atmosphere of a place or situation and react accordingly. If it's tense and serious, I express<U+200B> myself very carefully and conservatively. If it's free and fun, I express myself the most out of anyone there. It really depends on the atmosphere. I'm very comfortable around my old college friends and my role was really almost the \"glue\" of the group, emotionally. I'd get everyone happy and participating and stuff like that. I can be very expressive then. Because of negative stereotypes associated with men and emotional expression, rumors of me being homosexual existed, too.With certain people I'm not as fond of, I create an emotional barrier which is polite, but cold and hurried. In this way, I'm not very expressive at all with certain people. Less than other types with lower  usually are. But it's calculated and very much so still an  reaction. We can honestly go from warm-cold in seconds. But I think that how we show that warmth or coldness is influenced a bit by Enneagram type. I notice that many  2s (and 2s in general) are more likely to try and assert some kind of emotion onto the situation, whereas I adapt myself to it to try and blend in (which is a 9 thing to do). So if they walked in on a room full of tense people, they may try and \"fix\" it. They're better at that as a whole. I feel as though they'd be more obvious about showing that they aren't a fan of someone, too, and will wear that on their sleeve. If someone wronged them, the world knows about it. :P This is very possible behavior for an  of course, but I don't think all  would react this way.But, honestly, 9s will still wear their emotions on their sleeve, just not as obnoxiously as some people think -doms always do. The warmth and coldness I show toward people is usually very much obvious in its own way. It's different from being super gushy or screaming at someone, so it's not some grand and dramatic display much of the time. 9s hate that no matter their MBTI type. But I can't hide it like certain Thinking types can all the same (they are usually less discriminate about how much/little - usually little - they express themselves to others). The other person usually very much knows that something is off between myself and them exclusively. And it's because I bend my emotional expressiveness for each person like that. Purposely keeping conversation short and cool is an outward display of emotion in itself, just like being ebullient is when I'm around friends I love. And, again, it's obvious when it's deliberate compared to, say, certain people with a dominant Thinking function. Lastly, negative emotions such as anger and sadness are usually pushed down or misdirected in passive aggressive ways when it comes to 9s. I certainly do this. I'll unload on somebody and act like an ass online because I had a bad day. But I won't say a word to the person that actually made me mad. And while I see a lot of  9s push it down completely and really internalize anger, it usually \"leaks out\" more obviously when it comes to high  users. I know it does for me. So in the end, the amount and way I express myself is still fairly obvious, but it's not super over the top of dramatic. I'm still primarily led by my emotions and adjusting myself based on the \"outside world\" though.", "Thanks!I could buy a lacrosse ball, but just to make sure that I can't be a cheapskate...

Functions give you a good idea of why people tend to perceive and judge the world in a certain way. I do typical  things like brainstorm, see possibilities, or whatever else you associate with  because it's my dominant function and that's just how my brain works. The Enneagram is more about core desires and fears that drive you to do a certain thing. While people type based on behaviors a lot, it's about *why* they behave that way. I know that, as a 7w6, my reason, or even my desire, for researching personality theories is much different from that of a 4, which is much different from that of an 8. You could say the same thing about pretty much every behavior. We all do certain things, but for different reasons: to satisfy different needs within us or rebel against different fears within us, if that makes any sense.

I like to help others and get to know them personally. I love hearing stories about people in humorous situations, overcoming obstacles, etc. I have a pretty optimistic of humanity, and I think that we can become less violent one day. Plus, nothing beats a good group dynamic. In a more shallow sense, I love company and I'm not a fan of being alone unless I'm focused on some project, so people give me companionship. Overall, being an extrovert, I'm drawn to them and I want to understand why people do the things that they do. The MBTI tells us how people perceive and process things, but the Enneagram focuses on motives (personally more interesting for me). It helps me relate to others because, if I can, understanding why somebody does something makes it easier to help them or at least not hold it against them as much. This works for me, too. I want to improve as a person, and the Enneagram helps me understand why I do things and what I can do to improve. It isn't a flattering system; it points out flaws more than the MBTI and, while it makes the Enneagram less popular and harder to swallow, I feel as though it's super beneficial.", "Yeah LOVE. felt off to me.

If it's a surprise I try to judge based on their character. If it's mine and I'm planning it, great! I like doing the regular birthday party with a cake and all that. For me, decorations would be minimal and more to do with color schemes than actual objects (making sure the plates match the tablecloth, but I'm not going to purchase an ice sculpture or a piÃ±ata for example). I'd get a friend to help me bake the cake because I'm average at baking, unless the person wants an ice cream cake. They'll have to accept a store-bought cake at that point. If it were my party I'd make a cheese cake (again, with help lol). Games would be non-structured.2. All of my close friends, or all the close friends of the person it's for. Well, I say this, but I have a habit of inviting the whole world. If my friends are having a get-together and I see a different friend at lunch, I'll 95% of the time mention it to them and ask them to come.3. This is hard because I'd be one of the people to socialize instead of playing the game. As long as I'm included in the socializing, it's fine. But if the game is amazing and people lose interest, I'd feel sad on the inside. My friends and I were having a birthday party and had two games: Cards Against Humanity and a game (forget the name) that combined Telephone and Pictionary. The second game was so much fun! But everyone moved onto to Cards Against Humanity (which is cool, but I had already worn that game out). I was sad, but went with the flow.4. If everyone had fun and no unnecessary drama happened.

I think it is more likely that Mao could have killed C.C. to take her code, since his Geass was in both eyes, but was unwilling to do so since he loved and idolized her so much.  It would seem that developing a willingness to kill the one who gave you power is also requisite for completing the contract.  It's oddly reminiscent though not exactly like the rule of two with Sith lords in Star Wars.Why C.C. goes after Lelouch intentionally after Mao isn't certain.  My guess would be that after Marianne entered Anya, she contacted C.C. via linking through C's world to tell her to protect, watch-over, and/or make a contract with her son for his general wellbeing during the ensuing war between Britannia and Japan.Remember that C.C. is a coodere archetype, so even though she plays it cool most of the time, deep down she really loves Lelouch.  C.C. also says to Mao, \"I did love you, once\".  C.C. was probably heartbroken and looking for someone to replace the void after Mao failed as a child.

He's single handedly won me games even if he's a bit unpredictable.14 - Lamar Miller - This was a snake draft, but it cycled from top to bottom twice for keeping people from previous season even though this was our league's first.  Can't say I'm super happy with Miller, but it's more his offense's fault.19 - Russel Wilson - There was an early QB grab, and it made sense with our league's rules bolstering QB points.  He's helping me kill it now, but it has been a rough season.  Glad I kept him on the bench.30 - Jamaal Charles - I knew he was injured, but had been reading he'd be back within the first month.  Knowing his history I thought it would be a great grab for later games, and we all know how that went.35 - T.Y. Hilton - Been pretty happy with him, not much else to say.46 - Carson Palmer - Sloppy, senile, washed up.  Dropped him over a month ago, and the guy who picked him off the waivers last week lost that week for starting him over Marcus Mariota (Hi Mike).  QB is a position I've struggled with all season.51 - Eric Decker - He was great to have for the two weeks he played.  He has been missed.62 - Delanie Walker - Had some rough patches early, but has been a wonderful set and forget TE recently.67 - Latavius Murray - Terrible choice.  You really need better RBs than him in an 8 man.  He has been doing better as of late, but I dropped him when he was injured ages ago.78 - Emmanuel Sanders - I just dropped him for Donte Moncrief.  While he had a few great games early season, he'd been sitting on my bench for ages.83 - Allen Hurns - Dropped ages ago.94 - Stephen Gostkowski - Never drafting a kicker with any degree of priority again.99 - Ryan Tannehill - Ugh110 - Vincent Jackson - No clue who this is, dropped him, never used him.115 - Panthers Defense - I think Defense should just be grabbed off the waiver.  Keep one if you really like what they're doing for you.126 - Frank Gore - Glad I grabbed him.  Made a rookie mistake of dropping him instead of Latavius when I grabbed Blount off the waivers131 - Joe Flacco - Meh.  He's fun to listen to screaming in a no huddle offense, but not good for too much else even in 2QB.  He's on waivers now.142 - Markus Wheaton - Who?147 - Eric Ebron - Kind of wish I still had him on my bench right now.  Didn't mind dropping him ages ago.", "It's all good.  Flash Godrun can sit on my bench as long as he needs.", "How am I supposed to trust Jonathan Stewart.

Even last week with Gronk out, in my PPR league(Lewis had 4 receptions and Blount 0), against a Jets defense that gives trouble to bigger power backs, Blount still outscored Lewis.  Rams defense won't hold back the Blount anywhere near as much as the Jets did.  One of the Ram's DEs is questionable this week too.  Blount is also the back used primarily to run up the score once the Pats are ahead, and there is no doubt in my mind that NE will trounce LA.", "Mother 2 is just a solid game in it's own right, and definitely worth a full play through.  If you're already part of the way through it, then I would encourage you to finish prior to starting mother 3.

It will help you have the full experience.", "I was more surprised that Lelouch knew how to pilot a Knightmare in the first place.  He's just a high school student with no military training.  I guess we are just supposed to accept that he's intelligent to figure it out fast enough on his own.  The overall story, and what it represents is more important than all the minor details.  Even if most of them are explained or aren't too difficult to figure out.", "Schneizel is definitely better at figuring out moves in advance.  Throughout R2 he has lelouch and the black knights pinned down, and is anticipating their moves well in advance.  Once the Black Knights escaped to the chinese federation, Schneizel was planning the empress Tianzi's wedding.  He figured out Suzaku's and Zero's connection and caught Zero for a brief moment at the Kururugi Shrine.  He even suspected the surprise attack on Tokyo.The only reason lelouch can beat him is because of his lack of desire to win.  The chief feature of the white king is a lack of desire.  That is why Schneizel only plays games he can't lose.  He won't struggle to force a victory, or put his back against a wall to inspire desperation in his allies.  The second situations like that start to form he turns tail and runs.  That's what happens at the end of the Chinese Federation arc, and with the Damocles.Whether or not Schneizel is a sociopath depends on the side you take.  If you support the white side, then he is a utilitarian only seeking the best outcome for the greatest number of people.  If you support lelouch and the black side, then he is a sociopath that needs to be stopped.", "Schneizel didn't want to destroy the Damocles though.  He wanted to initially use it to kill a billion people to demonstrate its power, then keep it intact as a constant source of fear that would maintain peace.  Lelouche saw this as a form of stagnation similar to Charles' solution since people would be too afraid to express their own free will.", "I'll answer all of your questions in order.  First off, he's confirmed still alive.  R3 is titled Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection.  If you didn't catch all the evidence supporting this then you need to rewatch the series.  If the emperor placing his encoded hand around Lelouch's neck as he died wasn't enough, pay attention to C.C.'s comments prior to the requiem in the last episode.  Lelouch needs to disappear for the requiem to work.  People need to think he's dead, and he can't risk being found out in public.  Suzaku will take care of Nunally better than Lelouch could.  In his own words, \"I'm a soldier, Lelouch.  Can you make use of that information?\"  Suzaku will follow orders to the bitter end, and his Geass order to live makes it impossible for him to be killed.  Suzaku and Nunnally also care deeply about one another, and you see Suzaku in the Zero costume pushing Nunnally around in the ending sequence.  If Suzaku is with Nunnally, and there is ever an attempt on her life, Suzaku will ensure that both escape to safety without fail.  That isn't something Lelouch can do.", "That feel when your favorite pizza chain sponsors your favorite anime.", "He does have to suffer the pain of death, albeit minus the consequences.  And he's leaving his beloved sister behind.  His death is not without sacrifice.", "I wish there'd be a dub.  The picture dramas would be great too, but I highly doubt those would see a dub unless the Lelouch of the Rebellion disks out in Oct and Akito perform well beyond expectations.", "As I'm rewatching that's definitely the case.  They both show up around the same time in episode 1.  They both interact closely with each other at the beginning of the series too with Diethard being a media man for Jeremiah when he was Margrave.You can even draw parallels about them.  Both rush headlong into the action because they are seeking glory.  Jeremiah through battle, and Diethard through media influence.  At the end of the show Diethard has the power to rewrite history, Jeremiah has the power to rewrite Geass.  In the last few episodes they both become right-hand men to the leaders they respectively serve.", "The first time I watched through I decisively enjoyed R1 more.  The battle at Narita story arc is perhaps my favorite of the season. Now that I've seen it through twenty times I have to say R2 is much better.  The Chinese Federation arc is by far my favorite in the whole show, even though I saw it as a random detour my first time through.  Now I realize how essential it was.  Anyone who thinks R2 is missing anything needs to watch it again.  It is even faster paced than R1, if such a thing could even be possible, so it's very easy to miss many of the important details.  You have to pause the show after every line in C's world to grasp the full meaning.R1 also happens on a microcosmic scale.  It's more about the plight of the individual, while R2 is macrocosmic focusing more on the interconnectedness of all life on earth, as well as the role of the collective unconscious.  So which one you like better may have to do with your preference for the themes involved.", "I like the Schneizel breaking the Geass possibility.  No other serious potential enemy from R2 remains who would want to undo the Zero requiem.  Otherwise you'd have to introduce someone new.  Perhaps a religious order that believes it is within human nature to be violent, and that the present peace is a sham that must be undone.Keep in mind Suzaku doesn't know lelouch is still alive. Suzaku was left out of the loop as far as understanding the full ramifications of Geass codes.  He thinks he legit killed his best friend at the end of the show, and his ignorance was necessary so that he would continue to look after Nunally and the post requiem world in Lelouch's place.  If Lelouch reveals to Suzaku that he's still living, Suzaku might view that as a betrayal of trust, or as a miracle.  That kind of a reveal wouldn't happen off camera before the show starts. It would be a major part of a potential R3.I could see the season going down with Lelouch hiding behind the scenes forming Geass contracts alongside C.C. with new people to enact his will upon the world.  Knowing Lelouch he would want a full chess board of pieces so he'd probably form several contracts.  There'd have to be a story arc about someone he made a contract with betraying him who's trying to solve the age old problem of figuring out how to kill an immortal being.", "It's his special way of expressing joy and excitement.  He claps the loudest when he finds Nunally left alone when he captures her.  He also claps when he's bored and wishes the moment were more exciting.  Not only is Mao mentally unstable, but his mind is still very childish.  \"Still as childish as ever\" according to C.C.  He's a kid inside an adult's body.Remember that Mao is a failed geass user.  He is one of many representations of what people with power shouldn't be like.  Aware of his conscious control over situations yet doesn't exercise it.\"There's the part of you that's a critic, constantly watching your own moves... and there's another part that's an observer watching the critic -- watching you.  You're that kind of person.\" -Mao to LelouchOne of the best lines in the show.  If Mao wanted to control his geass, he should be more like Lelouch in this respect.", "Yes, I doubt they'd PLAN for an eleven pilot given prejudices.  That's not to say that Lloyd wouldn't take one given no other options because of his complete disregard for social etiquette.You're also forgetting that Lloyd is whimsical to borderline crazy, and wants to gather test data at any cost.  Him searching for a viable or better alternative amongst the lightly wounded isn't so farfetched.", "Drink every time Suzaku does something stupid.", "C.C. was talking to Marianne throughout the entire show via C.C.'s link to C's world.  It wasn't really a surprise.", "Lelouch has a solid sense of playful dry wit throughout the series.  I found it funny how he was always able to piss off Jeremiah by calling him orange boy.  But it's true that humor really isn't his most stockpiled commodity.  Ditto on the lack of social etiquette.  There was that time he didn't understand why Shirley was so upset that he had dates with every girl on campus.  Definitely a fish out of water in the social arena.", "AirBnB also pulls in lots of tourists to places where people are just trying to live their lives.

Usually funny or enjoy a good laugh - an amazing number of comedians are Sevens with a 6 wing. More openly vulnerable, have an unguarded, tender sweetness. Some have trouble expressing anger even when they are justified. May evade or finesse authority but still aware of it like a 6. Canny and practical, they look for the deals and the loopholes. When more entranced, may have surprise episodes of sensitivity and insecurity. Their feelings can be easily hurt sometimes. Sensitive especially to comparisons. May avoid putting themselves to the test. Grow dependent and addicted to other people, afraid to be alone, suspicious and skittish. Can feel guilt easily, may project their conscience onto others and then act irresponsibly. Make themselves shallow, fall in and out of love easily. Sometimes breezily betray others by running away. Can be reckless, unstable, and self-destructive. When Sevens have a counterphobic 6 wing their idealism can motivate a sincere desire for social reform. May work hard for a cause. Can be antiauthority, passive/aggressive, flippant, defiant. Some report hating to be told what to do. May call down trouble on themselves. Complain about the status quo. The realm of hippie rebellion.And 7w8:When healthy, Sevens with an 8 wing are often generous, gregarious and expansive. Tend to be exceptionally loyal to their friends, especially when social subtype. Leap aggressively to the defense of those they care for. Might seem loud or boisterous although some are urbane and witty. Enjoy social celebrations, storytelling, jokes, food and travel. Generally have a strong self-confidence for worldly matters and getting what they want. Talent for making something out of nothing - entrepreneurial. Usually share what they have when healthy, want everyone to enjoy their sense of bounty and wide range of interests. When more entranced, they may be demanding, displaying a selfish impatience and a self-justifying narcissism. May want what they want right now. Aggressive, hasty drive to acquire money and material options and recognition. Can demand that the people in their lives say only what the Seven wants to hear - sugarcoated truth. Lash out angrily if reality doesn't meet their expectations; sometimes vengeful. Often perfectionistic as parents (low side of 1). Moralize to others and then are themselves irresponsible.

That scene in Episode I when Padme walked in, and he asked if she was an Angel that lived \"on the moon of lego, I think.\" He wanted to learn about the galaxy beyond his shit hole of a planet, Tatooine. His knowledge was also very evident by his mechanical and technological expertise. He built C-3P0 as a *kid*. As a fucking *kid*. He even told Watto that despite the fact his podracer had been destroyed, he had been rebuilding it. Now, on average, I can tell you that most nine year old boys are not tinkering with robots that have actual artificial intelligence or building space nascar racers. But Anakin was no ordinary boy. He was the Chosen One, with  as his Dominant function. We also saw this throughout Anakin's growth to adulthood. Everything had to have a logical reason to him. In Episode II, during the assassin chase scene when Obi-Wan asks him what took him so long, you can hear Anakin attempt to reason why he was so late. He couldn't find a speeder with the XYZ specifications he liked. Any other type without a  dom function would've just picked a random speeder and booked it outta there. But no, Anakin actually cared about the details.I mean, there are many, MANY more examples for why Anakin is a  dom, so I'll just list a couple more: In the meadow scene in Episode II, when he and Padme are talking politics, he wanted to hear a logical explanation for why people couldn't just agree. Padme couldn't provide that to him, and that bothered him. That's when he learned that politics isn't necessarily about what's rational. It's about what people want.**:** Anakin was, by and large, a thrill seeker. Knowing how to build a pod racer was one thing. Actually racing it for himself was another. Anakin was performing physical stunts that no other nine year old could possibly accomplish. When Qui-Gon Jinn told him, \"Feel, don't think. Use your instincts\", he was already doing that. It's how he managed to be the youngest pod-racer in galactic history. Anakin could feel the Force during his races, and that ultimately helped him win. It's how he managed to jump into the cockpit of a Naboo starfighter and take out an entire droid command ship with absolutely no star fighter flying experience whatsoever.In Episode II, Anakin, during his teenage years, leaps before he thinks. Literally. It's an inherent part of his character that we see throughout the movie. During the assassin chase scene, he jumps out of his own speeder and falls several stories before landing on Zam Wessell's speeder in an attempt to stop her. Later, when Anakin gets visions of his mom dying, he rushes back to Tatooine to find her without thinking much of the risk to Padme's security. During the final confrontation with Dooku, he tries to rush Dooku but gets owned. He then gets back up and tries to rush him again, but this time with two lightsabers instead of one.In Episode III, we see he is somewhat of an adrenaline junkie when he tries to outmaneuver the homing missiles. There were a number of ways he could've done it, but instead he pulls this maneuver where he breaks until the last minute, and then speeds up so that the missiles collide into one another. You can see the satisfaction on his face when he says \"We got 'em, R2.\"**:** This is Anakin's tertiary function, so it isn't as developed as his others. But the underdevelopment totally shows in Episodes II and III. One of the recurring conflicts throughout the prequel movies is Anakin's struggle to see future events and his problems with authority. He has premonitions that things will occur, but can't always see the future consequences of those events. He also has difficulty taking orders from people he believes are holding him back.In Episode II, he constantly exercises brash judgment and rushes into things without much thinking them through. Remember, Anakin is a hot head, so he's not one to sit and think about things. He wants to strike the iron while it's hot. He also has visions that his mom is dying. He feels like this means something, but can't explain what, so he rushes back to Tatooine to find her. Anakin also doesn't like taking orders. In Episode II, when he's made head of security, he gets into a squabble with Padme about who can make the best decisions. But he ultimately defers to Padme's judgment because he didn't really about the constraints on his decisions since was deferring to Padme, his love.In Episode III, his entire motivation for living is trying to save Padme from the vision's he had. Nothing else really mattered to him. And if that meant committing questionable acts, such as learning abilities from the Dark Side in order to save her life, then he was willing to do it. In Palpatine's arrest scene, when Anakin sees Mace Windu standing over Palpy about to execute him, he struggles to make his choice because he can't clearly see the future implications of either choice. Does he let Mace kill Palpy, thereby destroying his one chance of saving Padme's life? Or does he stop Mace and save Palpy, thereby joining the Dark Side? We all know what happened afterward, but that struggle he has to see the future consequences of his actions--that is total .**:** This is Anakin's least developed function, and it is blatantly obvious. Anakin was not the type to care about being nice, or maintaining social pleasantries. He wanted to get straight to the point. For this reason, Anakin never really minced words. In fact, when Anakin did speak to others, he often had a sharp tongue that came across as overly critical. Just listen to him complain about how much Obi-Wan was holding him back in Episode II. Despite this, Anakin wanted to be genuinely liked. He wanted to mean something to someone. It's one of the reasons Palpatine was able to exploit him so easily. Palpy adopted Anakin as his mentee, and over the years fed him encouragements, praises, and other esteem and confidence building pleasantries, and Anakin ate it all up.Overall, Anakin fits the archetype of an  to a \"T\". He's a logical, adrenaline junkie that acts on impulse. He enjoys the physical and mental stimulation of working with his hands on projects like his podracer, droids, and even his own mechanical arm (the symbolism on that is pretty telling, btw), and he would rather let his actions do all the talking. This behavior largely fit his style of jumping into action and asking questions later.So, no, Anakin is NOT an  because Anakin's motivations were always more introverted than extroverted. Unlike an , Anakin didn't seek attention for the sake of getting attention. More tellingly, he also had no clear moral code.  users know right from wrong. At least, they think they do. For an ,  is also the auxillary function, so it is highly developed. To say that Anakin's moral code was highly developed would be flat out wrong because that's something he constantly struggled with. His internal struggles came to a head in Episode III when he couldn't even decide whether to join the Dark Side to save Padme's life, even if that meant destroying the Jedi.So there ya have it. If you actually Google the Star Wars MBTI types, there is a chart that has all of the major characters on it assigned to a type. For the most part, it's pretty darn accurate. You'll find that the chart also concurs with me in typing Anakin as an .", "Fair enough. So there's no such thing as jumping the gun? In other words, the timing is irrelevant.

No offense to the screenwriters, but when you have so much SW lore and history at your disposal but you literally don't do anything to use any of it, that's a huge disappointment. It's bad enough that Disney axed the EU and basically stuck it to all the hardcore fans. The least it can do to make up for that is tie Snoke's character to someone we've already seen/heard about--be it Plagueis, Mace Windu, or whomever. Just throw us a damn bone for once.

Both have issues communicating with each other, especially with regards to making decisions.Mom can't make quick decisions; Dad expects them to be made quickly, but defers to mom to make them. Mom shuts down and goes quiet, but Dad expects an answer from her. Dad goes ballistic when mom intentionally doesn't answer, and mom retaliates by saying dad is too controlling and never cares about her. Dad goes on rampage until he feels bad then shuts down and neither one speaks to the other. Until some other decision has to be made, dad expects mom to make it, she doesn't answer, and the cycle repeats again.It's become so tiring over the years. The police even had to respond to an argument because they received a complaint of a domestic disturbance.I'm an  and I see so many ways to fix this.
